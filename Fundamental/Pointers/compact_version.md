# Pointers

## Single and Double Pointers
- **Problem**: Demonstrating the difference between single and double pointers in C++
- **Approach**: Two functions showing different ways to update objects through pointers
- **Key Concepts**: Single pointers modify object content; double pointers can update the pointer itself
- **Issues**: Memory management concerns in the single pointer approach

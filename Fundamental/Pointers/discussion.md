# Pointers Discussion

## Single vs Double Pointers

### Single Pointers
Single pointers store the address of an object. When passed to a function, they allow modification of the object's content but not the address stored in the pointer itself.

Example:
```cpp
void modifyObject(Object* ptr) {
    ptr->setValue(10); // Modifies the object content
    // But we can't make ptr point to a different object
}
```

### Double Pointers
Double pointers store the address of a pointer. When passed to a function (as a pointer to a pointer), they allow modification of both the object content and the address stored in the original pointer.

Example:
```cpp
void updatePointer(Object** ptr) {
    delete *ptr; // Delete the old object
    *ptr = new Object(); // Update the original pointer to point to a new object
    (*ptr)->setValue(20); // Modify the new object
}
```

### Key Differences
1. **Modification Scope**: Single pointers can modify object content; double pointers can modify both content and the pointer itself
2. **Memory Management**: Double pointers provide more control over memory allocation and deallocation
3. **Use Cases**: Single pointers are common for general object manipulation; double pointers are used when the function needs to allocate or reallocate memory

### Best Practices
1. Always check for null pointers before dereferencing
2. Properly manage memory allocation and deallocation to avoid leaks
3. Use smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) in modern C++ to automate memory management
4. Prefer references over pointers when possible to avoid null pointer issues

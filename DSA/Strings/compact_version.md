## check_anagrams
- Notes: 
- logic was quite easy
- what i have learned how to use array as map for string
- how to work wiht string asccii and the 'a' subtraction

## check_palindrome
- Notes:
- the basic code of palindrome
- i did impkemented first whihc was wrokign for the ony same caps
- later i have learned to use trhe tolower to make it work for any case
- i later implemented the recursivce code to practicve my recursion skill
- Added implementations for checking palindromes in arrays (both iterative and recursive)
- Added alternative implementation for string palindrome checking

## first_non_repeating_character
- Notes:
- its anotehr code to get the first char non repeating char

## counting_valleys
- Notes:
- Count valleys in a hiking path using altitude tracking
- Increment valley count only when returning to sea level from below
- Uses simple iteration with altitude counter

## string_to_integer_atoi
- Notes:
- Implementation of custom atoi function to convert string to integer
- Includes iterative approach
- Handles whitespace, signs, and digit conversion

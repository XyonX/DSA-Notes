# Bit Manipulation

This folder contains problems related to bit manipulation techniques.

## single_number
- This problem demonstrates the power of XOR operations in solving array problems efficiently.
- The key insight is that XORing a number with itself results in 0, and XORing any number with 0 results in the number itself.
- This allows us to cancel out all duplicate elements, leaving only the unique element.
- This is a classic example of using bit manipulation to achieve both optimal time and space complexity.

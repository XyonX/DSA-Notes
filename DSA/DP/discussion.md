## Dynamic Programming Techniques

### Grid-Based DP
- **Unique Paths in Grid**: A classic DP problem where we count paths in a grid with movement constraints (right/down). Solved with recursion + memoization. See `Grid/problems/unique_paths` for details.

### General DP Patterns
- Tabulation vs. memoization.
- Optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.
- (More patterns to be added.)

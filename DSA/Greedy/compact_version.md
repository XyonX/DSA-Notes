# Greedy

This topic covers problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms, where we make the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.

## activity_selection
- Notes: Selects maximum number of non-overlapping activities using greedy approach

## fractional_knapsack
- Notes: Maximizes value in knapsack by taking items or fractions based on value-to-weight ratio

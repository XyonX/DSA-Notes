I really liked this one as it shows how cleanly we can use math to avoid loops. I started by forming an equation using n jumps: x1 + v1*n = x2 + v2*n Rearranged it: (v1 - v2)*n = x2 - x1 So, n = (x2 - x1) / (v1 - v2) Since n is a number of jumps, it must be a non-negative integer. So (x2 - x1) % (v1 - v2) must be 0 and result should be â‰¥ 0.

## bfs_traversal
- Notes: Implementation of BFS traversal using queue data structure. Handles disconnected components. Time complexity O(V + E).

## dfs_traversal
- Notes: Implementation of DFS traversal using recursion. Handles disconnected components. Time complexity O(V + E). Includes example with cycle.

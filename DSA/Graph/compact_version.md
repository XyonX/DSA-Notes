# Graph

## bfs_traversal
- Notes: Implementation of BFS traversal using queue data structure. Handles disconnected components. Time complexity O(V + E).

## dfs_traversal
- Notes: Implementation of DFS traversal using recursion. Handles disconnected components. Time complexity O(V + E). Includes example with cycle.

## number_of_provinces
- Notes: Counts connected components in a graph using DFS. Equivalent to number of islands problem. Time complexity O(V + E).

## bfs_traversal
Implementation of BFS traversal using queue data structure. The solution correctly handles disconnected components by iterating through all nodes. Time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

The implementation uses an adjacency list representation for the graph which is efficient for sparse graphs. The visited array ensures we don't process the same node multiple times.

Known issues:
1. Minor spelling error in comment: "startting" should be "starting"
2. The parameter `n` in the `bfs` function is not used (should use `n` instead of `adj.size()`)

Possible improvements:
1. Fix spelling errors in comments
2. Remove unused parameter `n` in `bfs` function
3. Add more comments to explain the code
4. Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `adn` for adjacent nodes

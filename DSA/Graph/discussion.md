# Graph Discussion

## bfs_traversal
Implementation of BFS traversal using queue data structure. The solution correctly handles disconnected components by iterating through all nodes. Time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

The implementation uses an adjacency list representation for the graph which is efficient for sparse graphs. The visited array ensures we don't process the same node multiple times.

Known issues:
1. Minor spelling error in comment: "startting" should be "starting"
2. The parameter `n` in the `bfs` function is not used (should use `n` instead of `adj.size()`)

Possible improvements:
1. Fix spelling errors in comments
2. Remove unused parameter `n` in `bfs` function
3. Add more comments to explain the code
4. Consider using a more descriptive variable name than `adn` for adjacent nodes

## dfs_traversal
Implementation of DFS traversal using recursion. The solution correctly handles disconnected components by iterating through all nodes. Time complexity is O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

The implementation uses an adjacency list representation for the graph which is efficient for sparse graphs. The visited array ensures we don't process the same node multiple times.

The example includes a directed graph with a cycle (2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2) which is correctly handled by the visited array. The code demonstrates both:
1. DFS from a specific starting node
2. Complete graph traversal covering all disconnected components

Key implementation details:
- Uses recursion for traversal (alternative would be iterative with explicit stack)
- Includes clear ASCII diagram of the example graph
- Well-commented code explaining the structure and traversal

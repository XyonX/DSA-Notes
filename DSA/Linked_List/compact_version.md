# Linked List Operations - Compact Version

## Create Linked List
- Creates a linked list from a vector of integers
- Uses a dummy head node to simplify list creation

## Display Linked List
- Prints the elements of a linked list to the console
- Traverses the list from head to tail

## Reverse Linked List
- Reverses a singly linked list by changing the direction of pointers
- Uses three pointers: temp, prev, and t

## Detect Cycle in Linked List
- Detects if there is a cycle in a singly linked list
- Uses Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (tortoise and hare)

## Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
- Merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list
- Creates a dummy head node to simplify the merging process

## Remove Nth Node From End
- Removes the nth node from the end of a linked list
- Uses two-pointer technique with proper edge case handling
- Status: attempted (needs more practice with edge cases)

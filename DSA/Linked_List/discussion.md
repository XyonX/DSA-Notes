# Linked List Operations - Discussion

## Overview
Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. This collection of linked list operations covers essential algorithms frequently encountered in technical interviews.

## Create Linked List
Creating a linked list from an array or vector is a common operation. The implementation uses a dummy head node to simplify the process of adding new nodes. This technique avoids special case handling for the first node.

## Display Linked List
Displaying a linked list is a basic traversal operation. It's important to understand how to iterate through a linked list without modifying it.

## Reverse Linked List
Reversing a linked list is a classic interview question that tests understanding of pointer manipulation. The iterative approach uses three pointers to reverse the direction of links between nodes.

## Detect Cycle in Linked List
Cycle detection is another important problem that uses the two-pointer technique. Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (also known as the tortoise and hare algorithm) is an efficient solution with O(1) space complexity.

## Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
Merging two sorted linked lists is a common problem that tests the ability to manipulate multiple pointers simultaneously. The solution creates a new merged list by comparing nodes from both input lists and selecting the smaller one at each step.

## Remove Nth Node From End
Removing the nth node from the end of a linked list is a problem that demonstrates the power of the two-pointer technique. The key insight is to maintain a gap of n nodes between two pointers, so when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer is at the (n-1)th node from the end. This allows for efficient removal in a single pass.

The implementation requires careful handling of edge cases:
1. When n equals the size of the list (removing the head node)
2. When the list is empty or has only one node
3. When n is larger than the size of the list

This problem is marked as "attempted" because while the solution works, more practice is needed to make the intuition clearer and handle edge cases more confidently.

## Key Takeaways
1. Linked lists require careful pointer manipulation
2. Dummy head nodes can simplify edge case handling
3. Two-pointer techniques are powerful for solving linked list problems efficiently
4. Understanding time and space complexity is crucial for evaluating solutions
5. Edge case handling is critical for robust linked list implementations

# Create Linked List

This function creates a linked list from a vector of integers.

## Implementation Details

- Uses a dummy head node to simplify list creation
- Iterates through the input vector and creates new nodes
- Returns the actual head of the list (dummy head's next)

## Time Complexity
O(n) where n is the size of the input vector

## Space Complexity
O(n) for creating n new nodes

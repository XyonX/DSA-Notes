# Matrix Operations

This code demonstrates various operations on 2D matrices in C++:

1. **Matrix Generation**: Creates a matrix with sequential values
2. **Display**: Prints the matrix in a readable format
3. **Row-wise Printing**: Traverses and prints the matrix row by row
4. **Column-wise Printing**: Traverses and prints the matrix column by column
5. **Diagonal Traversal**: Prints the main diagonal elements of a square matrix
6. **Spiral Order Traversal**: Prints matrix elements in spiral order
7. **Transpose**: Computes the transpose of a matrix (both with extra space and in-place)
8. **Rotate Matrix**: Rotates the matrix 90 degrees clockwise

## Key Points

- Uses `vector<vector<int>>` for matrix representation
- Includes helper functions for generating and displaying matrices
- Demonstrates different traversal techniques
- Handles square matrix validation for diagonal traversal
- Implements spiral traversal using boundary pointers
- Shows both extra-space and in-place implementations for transpose
- Implements matrix rotation using transpose and row reversal

## Known Issues

- Minor typos in comments: "antything" should be "anything", "columnd" should be "column", "squarte" should be "square"
- Some comments have grammatical issues that could be improved for clarity

## Time Complexity

- Matrix generation: O(rows × columns)
- Display: O(rows × columns)
- Row-wise printing: O(rows × columns)
- Column-wise printing: O(rows × columns)
- Diagonal traversal: O(min(rows, columns))
- Spiral traversal: O(rows × columns)
- Transpose (extra space): O(rows × columns)
- Transpose (in-place): O(rows × columns)
- Rotate matrix: O(rows × columns)

## Space Complexity

- O(rows × columns) for storing the matrix
- Transpose with extra space: Additional O(rows × columns) space
- All other operations work in-place with O(1) extra space (excluding input matrix)

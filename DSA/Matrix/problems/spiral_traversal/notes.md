# Spiral Traversal of Matrix

This problem involves traversing a 2D matrix in spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving inwards in a clockwise direction.

## Approach

1. Use four boundary pointers: top, bottom, left, and right
2. Traverse in four directions in each iteration:
   - Left to right along the top row
   - Top to bottom along the right column
   - Right to left along the bottom row (if within bounds)
   - Bottom to top along the left column (if within bounds)
3. After each traversal, move the corresponding boundary pointer inward
4. Continue until all elements are traversed

## Time Complexity

- O(m Ã— n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns

## Space Complexity

- O(1) additional space (excluding input matrix)

## Key Points

- This is a classic matrix traversal problem often asked in technical interviews
- Proper boundary checking is crucial to avoid accessing out-of-bounds elements
- The algorithm works for both square and rectangular matrices

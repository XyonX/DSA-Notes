# Matrix Discussion

## matrix_operations

This code provides a comprehensive set of functions for working with 2D matrices in C++. It includes:

1. **Matrix Generation**: The `gen` function creates a matrix of specified dimensions and fills it with sequential integers starting from 1.

2. **Display Function**: The `display` function prints the matrix in a readable format with proper row alignment.

3. **Row-wise Printing**: The `printRowWise` function traverses the matrix in the standard row-major order.

4. **Column-wise Printing**: The `printColumnWise` function demonstrates column-major traversal by swapping the order of the nested loops.

5. **Diagonal Traversal**: The `diagonalTraversal` function prints the main diagonal elements of a square matrix, with a validation check to ensure the matrix is square.

6. **Spiral Order Traversal**: The `printSpiral` function prints matrix elements in spiral order using four boundary pointers (top, bottom, left, right). This is a classic algorithm that traverses the matrix layer by layer.

7. **Transpose**: Two implementations are provided:
   - `transpose1`: Creates a new matrix and fills it with transposed values (extra space approach)
   - `transpose`: Modifies the original matrix in-place by swapping elements across the main diagonal

8. **Rotate Matrix**: The `rotateMat` function rotates the matrix 90 degrees clockwise by first transposing the matrix and then reversing each row.

### Implementation Details

- Uses `vector<vector<int>>` for dynamic matrix representation
- Includes proper bounds checking and error handling
- Demonstrates different traversal patterns that are fundamental in matrix algorithms
- Shows both extra-space and in-place implementations for common operations

### Potential Improvements

- Fix typos in comments and error messages
- Add more matrix operations like matrix multiplication, determinant calculation, etc.
- Implement input validation for all functions
- Consider template-based implementation for different data types
- Add unit tests for each function

## spiral_traversal

The spiral traversal problem involves visiting matrix elements in a spiral pattern starting from the top-left corner and moving inward in a clockwise direction.

This approach uses four boundary pointers (top, bottom, left, right) to control the traversal direction and ensure we don't revisit elements. It's an elegant solution that works for both square and rectangular matrices.

## transpose_matrix

Matrix transpose is a fundamental operation that flips a matrix over its main diagonal. Two approaches are commonly used:

1. **Extra Space Approach**: Creates a new matrix with swapped dimensions and copies elements appropriately. This works for any matrix shape.

2. **In-Place Approach**: Swaps elements across the main diagonal without using additional space. This only works for square matrices.

## rotate_matrix

Rotating a matrix by 90 degrees clockwise can be efficiently achieved in two steps:
1. Transpose the matrix (swap elements across the main diagonal)
2. Reverse each row

This approach works in O(nÂ²) time with O(1) extra space, making it optimal for this problem.

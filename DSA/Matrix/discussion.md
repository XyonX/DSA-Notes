# Matrix Discussion

## matrix_operations

This code provides a comprehensive set of functions for working with 2D matrices in C++. It includes:

1. **Matrix Generation**: The `gen` function creates a matrix of specified dimensions and fills it with sequential integers starting from 1.

2. **Display Function**: The `display` function prints the matrix in a readable format with proper row alignment.

3. **Row-wise Printing**: The `printRowWise` function traverses the matrix in the standard row-major order.

4. **Column-wise Printing**: The `printColumnWise` function demonstrates column-major traversal by swapping the order of the nested loops.

5. **Diagonal Traversal**: The `diagonalTraversal` function prints the main diagonal elements of a square matrix, with a validation check to ensure the matrix is square.

6. **Spiral Order Traversal**: The `printSpiral` function prints matrix elements in spiral order using four boundary pointers (top, bottom, left, right). This is a classic algorithm that traverses the matrix layer by layer.

7. **Transpose**: Two implementations are provided:
   - `transpose1`: Creates a new matrix and fills it with transposed values (extra space approach)
   - `transpose`: Modifies the original matrix in-place by swapping elements across the main diagonal

8. **Rotate Matrix**: The `rotateMat` function rotates the matrix 90 degrees clockwise by first transposing the matrix and then reversing each row.

### Implementation Details

- Uses `vector<vector<int>>` for dynamic matrix representation
- Includes proper bounds checking and error handling
- Demonstrates different traversal patterns that are fundamental in matrix algorithms
- Shows both extra-space and in-place implementations for common operations

### Potential Improvements

- Fix typos in comments and error messages
- Add more matrix operations like matrix multiplication, determinant calculation, etc.
- Implement input validation for all functions
- Consider template-based implementation for different data types
- Add unit tests for each function

# Matrix Discussion

## matrix_operations

This code provides a comprehensive set of functions for working with 2D matrices in C++. It includes:

1. **Matrix Generation**: The `gen` function creates a matrix of specified dimensions and fills it with sequential integers starting from 1.

2. **Display Function**: The `display` function prints the matrix in a readable format with proper row alignment.

3. **Row-wise Printing**: The `printRowWise` function traverses the matrix in the standard row-major order.

4. **Column-wise Printing**: The `printColumnWise` function demonstrates column-major traversal by swapping the order of the nested loops.

5. **Diagonal Traversal**: The `diagonalTraversal` function prints the main diagonal elements of a square matrix, with a validation check to ensure the matrix is square.

### Implementation Details

- Uses `vector<vector<int>>` for dynamic matrix representation
- Includes proper bounds checking and error handling
- Demonstrates different traversal patterns that are fundamental in matrix algorithms

### Potential Improvements

- Fix typos in comments and error messages
- Add more matrix operations like transpose, rotation, etc.
- Implement input validation for all functions
- Consider template-based implementation for different data types

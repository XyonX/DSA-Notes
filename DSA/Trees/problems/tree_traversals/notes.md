# Tree Traversals

Status: solved (practiced x2)

- Implemented recursive traversals: preorder (NLR), inorder (LNR), postorder (LRN).
- Added utilities: number of leaf nodes and height of binary tree.
- Sample tree built with nodes 1..7.
- Outputs are printed without separators.
- Time: O(n), Space: O(h) recursion stack.

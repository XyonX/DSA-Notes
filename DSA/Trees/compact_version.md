## tree_traversals
- Notes: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder traversal implementations on a perfect binary tree (1..7). Prints nodes without separators; complexity O(n).

## binary_search_tree
- Notes: Implementation of a Binary Search Tree with insert and in-order traversal methods. Time complexity for search/insert is O(log n) on average.

## level_order_traversal
- Notes: Implementation of level order traversal (BFS) for a binary tree using a queue. Time complexity O(n), space complexity O(w) where w is maximum width.

## tree_traversals
- Notes: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder traversal implementations on a perfect binary tree (1..7). Prints nodes without separators; complexity O(n).

## binary_search_tree
- Notes: Implementation of a Binary Search Tree with insert and in-order traversal methods. Time complexity for search/insert is O(log n) on average.

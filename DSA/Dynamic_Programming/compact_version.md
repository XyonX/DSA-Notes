## Climbing Stairs
- Notes: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. You can either climb 1 or 2 steps at time. How many distinct ways can you climb to the top? This follows the Fibonacci sequence.

## Frog Jump
- Notes: Given a number of stairs and a frog that can jump 1 or 2 steps at a time, with energy costs based on height differences, find the minimum energy required to reach the top stair. This is a variation of the climbing stairs problem with cost optimization.

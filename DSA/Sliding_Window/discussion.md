# Sliding Window - Discussion

## birthday_chocolate
This problem involves finding the number of ways to divide a chocolate bar based on sum and length constraints. 

The solution uses the sliding window technique with two pointers to efficiently find all valid segments. The approach expands the window by moving the right pointer and contracts it when the sum exceeds the target by moving the left pointer. 

This was a satisfying problem to solve as it was the first time the sliding window technique was applied independently without being told it was the appropriate approach.

## find_subarray_with_given_sum

- This problem, "Subarray Sum Equals K", is a classic array manipulation problem. The goal is to find a contiguous subarray whose elements sum up to a given target value.

There are two common approaches to solving this problem:

1.  **Sliding Window:** This approach is efficient but only works for arrays with all positive numbers. It involves maintaining a "window" of elements and expanding or shrinking it to find the target sum.

2.  **Prefix Sum with Hashmap:** This is a more versatile approach that works for arrays with both positive and negative numbers. It involves calculating the prefix sum at each index and using a hashmap to quickly check if a subarray with the target sum exists.

## rotate_array_right
- This problem discusses array rotation to the right by `k` positions. Both a brute-force approach and an optimal in-place solution using the reversal algorithm are presented.

**Brute-Force Discussion:**
This method involves creating a new array and copying elements in the desired rotated order. While straightforward, its main drawback is the additional space complexity of O(N), which can be significant for large arrays.

**Optimal Solution (Reversal Algorithm) Discussion:**
This in-place technique is highly efficient. It leverages the property that reversing parts of the array and then the whole array achieves the desired rotation. The three steps (reverse last k, reverse first n-k, reverse whole array) ensure that the elements are moved to their correct positions without requiring extra space. This makes it a preferred solution for competitive programming and real-world scenarios where memory optimization is crucial.

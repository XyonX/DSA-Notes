## find_subarray_with_given_sum

- This problem, "Subarray Sum Equals K", is a classic array manipulation problem. The goal is to find a contiguous subarray whose elements sum up to a given target value.

There are two common approaches to solving this problem:

1.  **Sliding Window:** This approach is efficient but only works for arrays with all positive numbers. It involves maintaining a "window" of elements and expanding or shrinking it to find the target sum.

2.  **Prefix Sum with Hashmap:** This is a more versatile approach that works for arrays with both positive and negative numbers. It involves calculating the prefix sum at each index and using a hashmap to quickly check if a subarray with the target sum exists.

## rotate_array_right

- This code implements a right rotation of an array by `k` positions. It creates a new vector `res` and first adds the last `k` elements of the original array, followed by the first `n-k` elements.

## find_mode_of_array
- Notes: Find the mode of an array.

## variance_of_array
- Notes: Find the variance of an array. Known Issues: This problem was not fully implemented. Will do it later.

## kadanes_algorithm
- Notes: Find the maximum subarray sum (Kadaneâ€™s algorithm).

## min_subarray_sum
- Notes: Find the minimum subarray sum.

## max_sum_non_adjacent_elements
- Notes: Find the maximum sum subarray with non-adjacent elements. Known Issues: Memoization is not yet implemented for this recursive solution.

## max_subarray_sum_min_length
- Notes: Find the subarray with the maximum sum and minimum length.

## min_sum_max_length
- Notes: Find the subarray with the minimum sum and maximum length.

## find_subarray_with_given_sum
- Notes: Find a contiguous subarray whose elements sum up to a given target value. Two approaches are implemented: sliding window (for positive numbers) and prefix sum with hashmap (for both positive and negative numbers).

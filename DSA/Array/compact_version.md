## find_mode_of_array

- Notes: Find the mode of an array.

## variance_of_array

- Notes: Find the variance of an array. Known Issues: This problem was not fully implemented. Will do it later.

## kadanes_algorithm

- Notes: Find the maximum subarray sum (Kadane's algorithm).

## min_subarray_sum

- Notes: Find the minimum subarray sum.

## max_sum_non_adjacent_elements

- Notes: Find the maximum sum subarray with non-adjacent elements. Known Issues: Memoization is not yet implemented for this recursive solution.

## max_subarray_sum_min_length

- Notes: Find the subarray with the maximum sum and minimum length.

## min_sum_max_length

- Notes: Find the subarray with the minimum sum and maximum length.

## find_subarray_with_given_sum

- Notes: Find a contiguous subarray whose elements sum up to a given target value. Two approaches are implemented: sliding window (for positive numbers) and prefix sum with hashmap (for both positive and negative numbers).

## rotate_array_right
- Notes: Implemented both a brute-force solution (O(N) time, O(N) space) and an optimal in-place solution using the reversal algorithm (O(N) time, O(1) space) for right array rotation.

## migratory_birds
- Notes: Find the most frequently sighted bird type. In case of a tie, return the smallest id.

## bill_division
- Notes: Calculate correct bill share for Anna and verify Brian's calculation.

## sock_merchant
- Notes: Count pairs of socks with matching colors using frequency map.

## generate_non_adjacent_subsequences
- Notes: Code to generate all subsequences with non-adjacent elements using recursion and backtracking. Known Issues: First implementation attempt has logical errors in handling adjacency.

## electronics_shop
- Notes: Find maximum sum of one keyboard and one USB drive within budget.
- Uses brute force with sorting optimizations.

## two_sum
- Notes: Find indices of two numbers that add up to a target value. Uses a hash map for O(n) time complexity.

## three_sum
- Notes: Find all unique triplets that sum to zero. Uses sorting and two-pointer technique for O(n^2) time complexity.

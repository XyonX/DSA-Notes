This problem, "Subarray Sum Equals K", is a classic array manipulation problem. The goal is to find a contiguous subarray whose elements sum up to a given target value.

There are two common approaches to solving this problem:

1.  **Sliding Window:** This approach is efficient but only works for arrays with all positive numbers. It involves maintaining a "window" of elements and expanding or shrinking it to find the target sum.

2.  **Prefix Sum with Hashmap:** This is a more versatile approach that works for arrays with both positive and negative numbers. It involves calculating the prefix sum at each index and using a hashmap to quickly check if a subarray with the target sum exists.

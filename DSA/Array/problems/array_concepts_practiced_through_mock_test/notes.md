# Array Concepts Practiced Through Mock Test

## Overview
Practiced fundamental array concepts through DSA mock test on 2025-08-15. Scored 21/30, identifying areas for improvement in understanding of data structures and algorithms fundamentals.

## Key Learnings
1. Data structures used for implementing recursion should be stack, not just any data structure
2. Time complexity of traversing a linked list is O(n), not O(log n)
3. Stable sorting algorithms - Quick Sort is not stable, while Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort are
4. Auxiliary space complexity of merge sort is O(n) due to temporary arrays used during merging, not O(log n)
5. Time complexity of building a heap from an array is O(n) using bottom-up construction, not O(log n)
6. Data structures for graph traversal:
   - BFS uses queue
   - DFS uses stack
7. Circular queue full condition is (rear + 1) % size == front, not just front == rear

## Areas for Improvement
- Need to review the specific properties and use cases of different data structures
- Should focus on understanding time and space complexities more deeply
- Need to distinguish between similar concepts (e.g., stable vs unstable sorting algorithms)
- Should practice more problems to reinforce fundamental concepts

# Recursion Problems

## string_to_integer_atoi
- Notes:
- Pure recursive implementation of the atoi function
- Handles whitespace, signs, digit conversion, and overflow
- Demonstrates recursion with multiple state parameters

## power_function
- Notes:
- Recursive implementation of the power function (x^n)
- Includes both basic and optimized versions
- Handles negative exponents and edge cases

## good_number_checker
- Notes:
- Recursive checker for "good numbers" based on position rules
- Even positions must have even digits, odd positions must have prime digits
- Uses helper function to check for prime digits

## count_good_numbers
- Notes:
- Counts good numbers of length n using combinatorics
- Uses fast exponentiation for efficient computation
- Even positions: 5 choices, odd positions: 4 choices

# Recursion Problems Discussion

## string_to_integer_atoi
- Pure recursive implementation of the ATOI function
- Uses multiple parameters to maintain state through recursive calls
- Handles the same key considerations as the iterative version:
  - Leading whitespace
  - Sign detection
  - Digit conversion
  - Overflow checking
  - Stopping at non-digit characters
- Demonstrates advanced recursion techniques with multiple state variables
- While less efficient in terms of space complexity due to the call stack, it's an elegant solution that breaks the problem into smaller subproblems

## power_function
- Implementation of the power function (x^n) using recursion
- Two versions provided:
  1. Basic recursive implementation that multiplies x by itself n times
  2. Optimized version that handles negative exponents and edge cases
- The basic version has precision issues with floating-point numbers
- The optimized version in the Solution class uses an iterative approach for power calculation, which is more efficient for large exponents
- This problem demonstrates how recursion can be used for mathematical computations

## good_number_checker
- Recursive solution to check if a number follows specific digit placement rules
- Even index positions must have even digits (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- Odd index positions must have prime digits (2, 3, 5, 7)
- Uses a helper function isPrime to check if a digit is prime
- Processes the number digit by digit from right to left
- Demonstrates how recursion can be used to process sequences with position-dependent rules

## count_good_numbers
- Combinatorics problem to count good numbers of length n
- Even positions: 5 choices (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- Odd positions: 4 choices (2, 3, 5, 7)
- Uses the formula: (5^(even positions) * 4^(odd positions)) % MOD
- Implements fast exponentiation (binary exponentiation) for efficient computation
- Although placed in the Recursion topic, this implementation is primarily mathematical and uses an iterative approach for exponentiation
- Shows how mathematical insights can optimize recursive or combinatorial problems

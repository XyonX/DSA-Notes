# Recursion Problems Discussion

## string_to_integer_atoi
- Pure recursive implementation of the ATOI function
- Uses multiple parameters to maintain state through recursive calls
- Handles the same key considerations as the iterative version:
  - Leading whitespace
  - Sign detection
  - Digit conversion
  - Overflow checking
  - Stopping at non-digit characters
- Demonstrates advanced recursion techniques with multiple state variables
- While less efficient in terms of space complexity due to the call stack, it's an elegant solution that breaks the problem into smaller subproblems

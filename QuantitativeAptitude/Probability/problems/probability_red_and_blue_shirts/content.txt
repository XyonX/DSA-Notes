6. A box has 6 black, 4 red, 2 white and 3 blue shirts. What is the probability that 2 red shirts and 1 blue shirt get chosen during a random selection of 3 shirts from the box?

Ans: This question is really interesting 
So we need to find the probability of getting 2 red shirts and 1 blue shirt 
Now here is the twist, we can either get 2 red and 1 blue this way like first one blue second one red and third one red or first one red, second one blue and third one red, or various other ways
As it's "or" we will need to add the probability of these 
Now what is this? How would you know in how many ways you can get 2 red and 1 blue shirt? Here comes the concept of permutation
We have 3 elements in set {red, red, blue} or if we make an int rep {1,1,2} so in general the permutation of 3 elements is 3! or 6 now here 2 are repeat so we divide by 2 so 3!/1! = 3 ways or the ways are 1,1,2 or 1,2,1 or 2,1,1 now if we go turn to color it will be red, red, blue or red, blue, red, or blue, red, red 
So we need to calculate the probability of finding 2 red and 1 blue in this 3 order as either any of them can take us to the answer so it's an or operation so +
So the ans = prob of getting 2 red and blue in this order(red, red, blue) + in this order (red, blue, red) + in this order( blue, red, red)
For the probability in this order, (red, red, blue) = 4/15 * 3/14 * 3/13
For the probability in this order, (red, blue, red) = 4/15 * 3/14 * 3/13
For the probability in this order, (blue, red, red) = 3/15 * 4/14 * 3/13
Now among these any of the paths will take us to the answer so the answer is adding them = (4/15 * 3/14 * 3/13) + (4/15 * 3/14 * 3/13) + (3/15 * 4/14 * 3/13) = 18/455

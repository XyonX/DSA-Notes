2.Two dice are thrown simultaneously. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers shown on the two dices will be a prime number?
solution/intuition:
so total 36 possibnilies if we throw dice 
we need to find all the combinatioon whoose sum to prime 
now the brute will be to create alo the permutaion(better approach is to create conmbiantiion) then check for how many of them make orimne sum
one mroe approach is opotimized so we calcaute the ranfge of sum two dice can make it starting form 2 to 6+6=12 now we check from 2-12 how many prime are there
2,3,5,7,11(these arethe porimne)

2
(1,1)

3
(1,2), (2,1)

5
(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)

7
(1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)

11
(5,6), (6,5)

total 15 so 15/36

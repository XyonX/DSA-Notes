# Probability Discussion

## probability_shirts_picked
- This problem demonstrates calculating probabilities for dependent events without replacement. When picking two items without replacement, the probability of the second event depends on the outcome of the first event.

## probability_ball_picked
- This is a straightforward probability addition problem for mutually exclusive events. We simply add the individual probabilities of picking a black ball or a green ball.

## probability_marbles_from_pots
- This problem involves conditional probability and the law of total probability. We consider the probability of selecting each pot (1/2 for each) and then the probability of drawing a red marble from that pot.

## probability_game_cards
- This problem demonstrates the principle of inclusion-exclusion in probability. When calculating the probability of the union of two events (green card OR important card), we add their individual probabilities and subtract the probability of their intersection (green AND important cards) to avoid double counting.

## probability_black_shirts
- Another example of dependent probability where the outcome of the first event affects the probability of the second event. After picking one black shirt, there's one less black shirt and one less total shirt in the box.

## probability_red_and_blue_shirts
- This problem demonstrates the application of permutations in probability calculations. When we're selecting multiple items and the order matters for our calculation, we need to consider all possible arrangements (permutations) of the desired outcome. Alternatively, this could also be solved using combinations, which would be a more direct approach for this type of problem.

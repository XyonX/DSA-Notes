Perfect 👍 This is an **important OS detail** because **BIOS/MBR vs UEFI/GPT bootstrapping** is frequently asked in interviews (and practical knowledge for sysadmins too).

# ⚡ BIOS vs UEFI in the Bootstrap Process

Both are **firmware interfaces** between hardware and OS, but they work differently.

---

## 1. **BIOS (Legacy) Boot Process**

- **Old standard** (since 1980s).
    
- Stored in ROM/Flash on motherboard.
    
- Uses **MBR (Master Boot Record)** partitioning.
    
- Can only address disks up to **2 TB**.
    
- Works in **16-bit real mode**, limited memory access.
    

### Steps:

1. **Power On** → CPU executes BIOS from ROM.
    
2. **POST** (Power-On Self-Test) checks CPU, RAM, devices.
    
3. BIOS looks for **bootable device** (according to boot order).
    
4. Loads **first 512 bytes (MBR)** from the disk into RAM.
    
5. MBR contains **bootloader** + **partition table**.
    
6. Bootloader loads the OS kernel into memory.
    

### ASCII Flow (BIOS + MBR):

```
[Power On]
    |
    v
[BIOS in ROM]
    |
    v
[POST → HW Init]
    |
    v
[Read 1st sector from disk (MBR, 512B)]
    |
    v
[Bootloader → Kernel]
    |
    v
[OS Running]
```

## 2. **UEFI Boot Process**

- **Modern replacement** for BIOS.
    
- Stored in Flash on motherboard.
    
- Uses **EFI System Partition (ESP)** with **GPT (GUID Partition Table)**.
    
- Can handle disks up to **9.4 ZB (zettabytes)**.
    
- Works in **32-bit or 64-bit mode**, full memory access.
    
- Provides **secure boot** (checks digital signatures).
    

### Steps:

1. **Power On** → CPU executes UEFI firmware from Flash.
    
2. UEFI firmware runs **POST**.
    
3. Loads **UEFI Boot Manager**.
    
4. Looks in the **EFI System Partition (ESP)** (a FAT32 partition).
    
5. Finds a **.efi executable file** (e.g., `grubx64.efi` for Linux, `bootmgfw.efi` for Windows).
    
6. The `.efi` bootloader loads the kernel into memory.
    
7. Kernel initializes and starts OS.
    

### ASCII Flow (UEFI + GPT):

```
[Power On]
    |
    v
[UEFI Firmware in Flash]
    |
    v
[POST → HW Init]
    |
    v
[UEFI Boot Manager]
    |
    v
[EFI System Partition (FAT32)]
    |
    v
[.efi Bootloader → Kernel]
    |
    v
[OS Running]
```

## ⚡ Key Differences (BIOS vs UEFI)

|Feature|BIOS (Legacy)|UEFI (Modern)|
|---|---|---|
|Boot Method|Reads **MBR (512B)**|Uses **EFI System Partition**|
|Disk Support|≤ 2 TB, 4 partitions max|> 2 TB, unlimited partitions|
|Mode|16-bit real mode|32/64-bit protected mode|
|Speed|Slower|Faster booting|
|Security|No security checks|**Secure Boot** (signature check)|
|Extensibility|Hard-coded, fixed|Modular, can load drivers/apps|
|Example OS|DOS, old Linux, Win XP|Modern Linux, Windows 10/11|

---

## 🔑 Quick Interview Summary

- **BIOS/MBR** = old, limited, simple → loads MBR (512B) → bootloader → kernel.
    
- **UEFI/GPT** = modern, secure, faster → uses EFI System Partition (FAT32) → loads `.efi` bootloader → kernel.

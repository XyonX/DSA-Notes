 User Process (User Mode)
 +-----------------------------+
 | user code (e.g., call read) |
 | user stack                   |
 | mode bit = 0 (user)          |
 +-------------+---------------+
               |
               | 1) system call / software interrupt
               |    (e.g., syscall, int 0x80, svc)
               v
 +-------------+---------------+
 | CPU saves user context      |
 | switches to kernel stack    |
 | flips mode bit = 1 (kernel) |
 +-------------+---------------+
               |
               | 2) kernel entry: dispatcher/handler
               |    validate args, check permissions,
               |    execute privileged operation (I/O, mmap, etc.)
               v
 +-------------+---------------+
 | Kernel (Kernel Mode)        |
 | device drivers, FS, IPC     |
 | access to full memory/hw    |
 +-------------+---------------+
               |
               | 3) prepare return (result / errno)
               |    restore user registers & stack
               v
 +-------------+---------------+
 | CPU restores user context   |
 | switches to user stack     |
 | flips mode bit = 0 (user)   |
 +-------------+---------------+
               |
               | 4) return to user process with result
               v
 User Process (User Mode) ‚Äî continues execution
```

### Short step-by-step (what actually happens)

1. **User code requests a service** ‚Äî e.g., `read()`, `open()`. That triggers a _system call instruction_ (or software interrupt).
    
2. **CPU traps to kernel** ‚Äî hardware saves minimal CPU state, switches stack to the kernel stack, and sets the privilege bit so code runs in kernel mode.
    
3. **Kernel checks & runs** ‚Äî kernel validates pointers/args, performs the privileged work (disk I/O, scheduling, memory ops), and prepares a result.
    
4. **Return to user** ‚Äî kernel restores CPU/user registers and stack, clears the mode bit, and returns control to the user process with the syscall result.
    

### Extra notes (quick interview bullets)

- The **mode bit / privilege level** prevents user code from doing privileged ops directly.
    
- **Stack switch**: kernel uses a separate kernel stack for the process (prevents user stack tampering).
    
- **Context switch?** Calling a syscall for the same process is _not_ necessarily a full context switch (still same process), but the CPU does switch stacks and privilege levels. A full context switch happens when the kernel schedules a different process.
    
- **Performance**: syscalls are more expensive than ordinary function calls due to the trap/stack switching and security checks.
    
- **Security/stability**: this split isolates faults ‚Äî user crashes won‚Äôt crash the kernel (unless there's a kernel bug).
    

Want a tiny example showing `read()` flow (registers used, syscall number) for Linux x86-64 or an ASCII timeline of cycles?


Great question üëç Let‚Äôs break it down in **simple interview-style notes**:

---

# üñ•Ô∏è Difference between **Kernel Mode** and **User Mode**

Modern operating systems run programs in **two modes** to ensure **security, stability, and proper resource management**.

---

## 1. **Definition**

- **Kernel Mode** ‚Üí The CPU runs with **full access** to system hardware and all instructions.
    
- **User Mode** ‚Üí The CPU runs applications with **restricted access**, only allowed to use safe instructions.
    

---

## 2. **Privileges**

- **Kernel Mode** ‚Üí Can execute **all CPU instructions** (privileged + non-privileged).
    
- **User Mode** ‚Üí Can execute **only non-privileged instructions**.
    

---

## 3. **Memory Access**

- **Kernel Mode** ‚Üí Has access to **all memory** (both user space & kernel space).
    
- **User Mode** ‚Üí Can access **only its own memory space**, not kernel memory.
    

---

## 4. **System Calls**

- **Kernel Mode** ‚Üí Not required, already has direct access.
    
- **User Mode** ‚Üí Must use **system calls** (traps) to request OS services (like file I/O, device access).
    

---

## 5. **Crash Impact**

- **Kernel Mode** ‚Üí If something goes wrong ‚Üí **entire system may crash** (Blue Screen in Windows, Kernel Panic in Linux).
    
- **User Mode** ‚Üí If something goes wrong ‚Üí **only that program crashes**, OS remains safe.
    

---

## 6. **Examples**

- **Kernel Mode** ‚Üí Device drivers, OS kernel, memory management, file system control.
    
- **User Mode** ‚Üí Applications like browsers, games, editors, etc.
    

---

## 7. **Performance**

- **Kernel Mode** ‚Üí Faster for privileged operations but dangerous.
    
- **User Mode** ‚Üí Safer, but slightly slower since it must request services via **system calls**.
    

---

### üîë Quick One-Liner for Interviews:

- **Kernel Mode** ‚Üí Full control, high risk.
    
- **User Mode** ‚Üí Limited control, safer for running applications.

üëâ Do you want me to also draw an **ASCII diagram** to visualize the transition between **user mode ‚Üí system call ‚Üí kernel mode**?

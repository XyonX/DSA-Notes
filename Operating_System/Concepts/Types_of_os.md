## Short captions / memory hooks (one line per type)

- **Batch:** jobs queued ‚Üí run ‚Üí results. Good hook: ‚Äúno keyboard while running.‚Äù
    
- **Time-sharing:** many users, fast switching ‚Üí interactive shells. Hook: ‚Äúmany terminals, one CPU.‚Äù
    
- **Multiprogramming / Multitasking:** keep CPU busy & run several apps. Hook: ‚Äúswitch when I/O blocks / preempt for responsiveness.‚Äù
    
- **RTOS:** timing guarantees matter. Hook: ‚Äúdeadlines > throughput.‚Äù
    
- **Distributed:** many machines, one logical system. Hook: ‚Äúshare resources across network.‚Äù
    
- **Network OS:** server-focused networking services. Hook: ‚Äúfile/printer/auth server.‚Äù
    
- **Embedded:** tiny OS for dedicated hardware. Hook: ‚Äúruns inside a device.‚Äù
    
- **Mobile:** optimized for battery, sensors, touch. Hook: ‚Äúapps, stores, mobile HW.‚Äù
    
- **Hybrid:** real world ‚Äî modern OS mix many features. Hook: ‚Äúnot purely one category.‚Äù

## 1. **Batch Operating System**

- **What it is:**  
    Early OS type where jobs are collected and processed in batches with _no interaction_ during execution.
    
- **Why it evolved:**  
    In the 1950s‚Äì60s, computers were expensive and slow. Batch OS maximized utilization by avoiding idle CPU time between jobs.
    
- **Difference:**
    
    - No direct user‚Äìcomputer interaction.
        
    - Input ‚Üí Execution ‚Üí Output, all in sequence.
        
- **Current status:** Rarely used now, replaced by interactive systems.
    
- **Example:** IBM Mainframes (Payroll, Bank reports).

## 2. **Time-Sharing Operating System**

- **What it is:**  
    Allows multiple users to interactively share a single CPU, giving the illusion that each has their own machine.
    
- **Why it evolved:**  
    Needed for universities and research labs where many users had to share expensive mainframes.
    
- **Difference:**
    
    - CPU time divided into small time slices.
        
    - Supports **interactive computing**.
        
- **Current status:** Still the basis of modern multi-user systems.
    
- **Example:** UNIX, Linux.
    

---

## 3. **Multiprogramming / Multitasking OS**

- **What it is:**
    
    - **Multiprogramming:** Several jobs kept in memory; CPU switches to next job when one waits (e.g., for I/O).
        
    - **Multitasking:** Extends multiprogramming to single users running multiple apps at once.
        
- **Why it evolved:**  
    To keep CPU busy at all times and allow better user experience.
    
- **Difference:**
    
    - Multiprogramming = _maximize CPU utilization_.
        
    - Multitasking = _user convenience (run many apps at once)_.
        
- **Current status:** Foundation of **all modern general-purpose OS**.
    
- **Example:** Windows, macOS, modern Linux distros.

## 4. **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)**

- **What it is:**  
    OS designed to process events and respond _within a strict time limit_.
    
- **Why it evolved:**  
    Needed for safety-critical and control systems where timing is crucial.
    
- **Difference:**
    
    - **Hard real-time:** Deadlines must never be missed (e.g., pacemaker).
        
    - **Soft real-time:** Occasional delays acceptable (e.g., video streaming).
        
- **Current status:** Common in embedded systems, robotics, and IoT.
    
- **Example:** VxWorks, QNX, FreeRTOS, RTLinux.

## 5. **Distributed Operating System**

- **What it is:**  
    Runs across multiple interconnected computers but makes them appear as a single system.
    
- **Why it evolved:**  
    To provide **resource sharing**, **fault tolerance**, and scalability as networks grew.
    
- **Difference:**
    
    - Manages multiple computers as if one.
        
    - Focus on transparency and reliability.
        
- **Current status:** Concept lives on in **cloud systems, clusters, and container orchestration**.
    
- **Example:** Amoeba, LOCUS.
    

---

## 6. **Network Operating System (NOS)**

- **What it is:**  
    Provides features for networking‚Äîfile sharing, user management, remote access.
    
- **Why it evolved:**  
    Needed when computers became interconnected in organizations.
    
- **Difference:**
    
    - Runs on a server and manages resources across a network.
        
- **Current status:** Superseded by distributed systems + modern server OS.
    
- **Example:** Novell NetWare, older Windows Server editions.

## 7. **Embedded Operating System**

- **What it is:**  
    Lightweight OS designed for dedicated hardware devices.
    
- **Why it evolved:**  
    Devices like ATMs, routers, and appliances needed tailored OS with small footprint.
    
- **Difference:**
    
    - Optimized for **low resources**.
        
    - Often real-time capable.
        
- **Current status:** Everywhere in consumer electronics, IoT, and industry.
    
- **Example:** FreeRTOS, Embedded Linux, ThreadX.
    

---

## 8. **Mobile Operating System**

- **What it is:**  
    OS designed for mobile devices with touch input, app stores, and power management.
    
- **Why it evolved:**  
    Smartphones demanded an OS optimized for connectivity, portability, and UI.
    
- **Difference:**
    
    - Focus on battery, touch interface, and mobile hardware.
        
- **Current status:** Dominates personal computing for billions of users.
    
- **Example:** Android, iOS.

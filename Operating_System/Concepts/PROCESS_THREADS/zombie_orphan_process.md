Nice, now you’re getting into **special process states** 🧠  
Let’s break down **Zombie** and **Orphan** processes with clear explanations + examples.

# 🧟 Zombie Process

### 🔹 What it is:

- A **process that has finished execution** but whose **parent has not yet read its exit status**.
    
- The process is _dead_, but its **PCB (entry in process table)** is still kept so the parent can later call `wait()` to collect its status.
    
- It’s basically a **“dead body waiting to be buried”**.
    

### 🔹 Why it happens:

- When a process finishes, it calls `exit()`.
    
- OS keeps its PCB until the parent acknowledges it with `wait()`.
    
- If the parent forgets to `wait()`, the zombie stays.
    

### 🔹 Example:

```bash
# Parent spawns child, but never waits
child ----> finishes execution
parent ---> does not call wait()

Result: child becomes ZOMBIE
```

📌 Run `ps -aux` on Linux → you may see `<defunct>` beside zombie processes.

# 👶 Orphan Process

### 🔹 What it is:

- A **child process whose parent has already terminated**.
    
- The child is still running, but since the parent is gone, it has no one to collect its exit status later.
    

### 🔹 What OS does:

- In Linux/Unix, **`init` (PID 1)** automatically adopts orphan processes.
    
- So orphans don’t become zombies forever — `init` reaps them.
    

### 🔹 Example:

```bash
parent ----> terminates
child ----> still running

Result: child becomes ORPHAN
```

# ⚡ Zombie vs Orphan (Quick Table)

|Feature|Zombie 🧟‍♂️|Orphan 👶|
|---|---|---|
|Process alive?|❌ Dead (finished execution)|✅ Still running|
|Parent alive?|✅ Parent still exists|❌ Parent terminated|
|PCB in memory?|✅ PCB kept until parent waits|✅ Normal PCB, adopted by `init`|
|Cleanup?|Needs parent to `wait()`|`init` adopts and cleans up|

---

✅ **Summary**

- **Zombie = finished but not reaped.**
    
- **Orphan = running but no parent.**

Would you like me to also **show a tiny C program** that demonstrates both (zombie and orphan) so you can run it and _see_ them in action with `ps`?

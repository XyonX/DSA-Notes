Perfect, you‚Äôre diving into the **heart of process management** üëå Let‚Äôs break down **context switching** clearly.

# üîπ What is Context Switching?

- **Definition**:  
    When the CPU switches from executing one process (or thread) to another, the **execution context** (CPU state) of the old process must be **saved**, and the new process‚Äôs context must be **loaded**.
    
- It‚Äôs handled by the **OS scheduler**.

# üîπ What is "Context"?

Context = all the information needed to resume a process later. Includes:

- **CPU registers** (general-purpose registers, program counter, stack pointer, etc.)
    
- **Process state** (running, waiting, etc.)
    
- **Memory management info** (page tables, segment registers)
    
- **I/O status** (open files, resources in use)
    

Stored in the **PCB (Process Control Block)** of each process.

# üîπ Steps in Context Switching

1. **Save state of current process**
    
    - Save CPU registers, program counter, stack pointer ‚Üí into PCB of current process.
        
2. **Choose next process**
    
    - Scheduler decides next ready process (based on scheduling algorithm: FCFS, RR, etc.).
        
3. **Load state of new process**
    
    - Restore CPU registers, program counter, stack pointer from PCB of the new process.
        
4. **Resume execution**
    
    - CPU continues execution from the point where new process left off.

# üîπ Context Switch Overhead

- **Overhead = CPU time spent saving/loading state** instead of executing actual user instructions.
    
- Why it‚Äôs costly:
    
    - Involves **kernel mode operations** (switching privilege levels).
        
    - Requires saving/restoring multiple registers.
        
    - Cache/TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) may need flushing (causing performance loss).
        
- Still, it‚Äôs **essential** for multitasking.

# üîπ Context Switching in Threads

- **Process switch**: More overhead (save registers, memory maps, kernel resources).
    
- **Thread switch within same process**: Less overhead (threads share memory & resources, so only registers/PC/stack need saving).

# ‚öñÔ∏è Analogy

- Imagine two students writing an exam on the **same desk**:
    
    - Before switching, one student must pack up all notes (save state).
        
    - Next student unpacks their notes (load state).
        
    - The time wasted in packing/unpacking = **context switch overhead**.
        

---

‚úÖ **Summary for interview**:

- Context switching = **saving old process state + loading new one**.
    
- Info stored in **PCB**.
    
- Necessary for multitasking, but introduces **overhead** (non-productive CPU time).
    
- **Thread switches are cheaper** than process switches.

Do you want me to also explain **hardware vs software role in context switching** (like which parts CPU handles and which OS handles)?

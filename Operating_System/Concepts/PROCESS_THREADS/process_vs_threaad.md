Very sharp question 👍 — let’s untangle this carefully.

---

# 🔹 Do threads “share the same variables” or “just the same address space”?

✅ **Threads share the same address space** → which means:

- All **global variables**, **static variables**, and **heap memory** are common to all threads.
    
- If one thread writes to a global variable (or heap), the change is **visible to all threads**, because they’re all reading from the same memory address.
    

❌ But:

- **Each thread has its own private stack** → so local (automatic) variables inside functions are **not shared**.
    

So it’s **both true**:

- They don’t literally “share the same copy of a variable” for locals on the stack.
    
- But they _can_ access each other’s data if they know the memory address, since they live in the same address space.

# 🔹 Memory Layout for Threads (inside one process)

Imagine one process with 3 threads:

```
Process Memory
 ├── Code Segment   (shared)
 ├── Data Segment   (global/static variables)  <-- shared
 ├── Heap           (malloc/new)               <-- shared
 ├── Stack (Thread 1)   <-- private
 ├── Stack (Thread 2)   <-- private
 └── Stack (Thread 3)   <-- private
```

- `global int counter;` → shared among all threads.
    
- `int x = 5;` inside a function → private to each thread (since it’s on that thread’s stack).
    

---

# 🔹 Example in C (POSIX threads)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

int shared_counter = 0;  // Global → shared

void* thread_func(void* arg) {
    int local_var = 0;  // Stack → private
    shared_counter++;
    local_var++;
    printf("Thread %ld: shared_counter=%d, local_var=%d\n",
           (long)arg, shared_counter, local_var);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t t1, t2;
    pthread_create(&t1, NULL, thread_func, (void*)1);
    pthread_create(&t2, NULL, thread_func, (void*)2);

    pthread_join(t1, NULL);
    pthread_join(t2, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```

### Possible Output:

```
Thread 1: shared_counter=1, local_var=1
Thread 2: shared_counter=2, local_var=1
```

👉 `shared_counter` is **incremented globally**, visible to both.  
👉 `local_var` is **independent** in each thread.

---

# 🔹 So the answer

- Threads **share the same address space**.
    
- This means they **can** access each other’s data, including globals, heap, and even another thread’s stack (if given a pointer).
    
- But by convention, each thread only touches its own stack.
    
- The only thing **not shared automatically** is the stack.
    

---

⚡ Analogy:

- Imagine a house (process) with roommates (threads).
    
- The **kitchen and living room** (globals & heap) are shared.
    
- Each roommate has their own **bedroom** (stack).
    
- In theory, one roommate _could_ sneak into another’s room, but that’s not polite (or safe).
    

---

Would you like me to also compare this with **processes** by showing a similar program with `fork()` instead of threads, so you can see how the data differs?


Exactly ✅ you got it right.

When we say **threads share the heap**, it means:

- Any memory allocated with `malloc` (C) or `new` (C++) goes to the **process heap**.
    
- Since all threads live inside the **same process address space**, every thread can access that heap memory.
    
- There is **only one heap per process**, not per thread.
    

---

### 🔹 Example in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    MyClass(int v) : value(v) {}
};

MyClass* sharedObject = nullptr;  // Global pointer

void worker(int id) {
    if (sharedObject) {
        sharedObject->value += id;
        std::cout << "Thread " << id << " updated value = " 
                  << sharedObject->value << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    // Allocate on heap → shared by all threads
    sharedObject = new MyClass(10);

    std::thread t1(worker, 1);
    std::thread t2(worker, 2);

    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    delete sharedObject;  // cleanup
    return 0;
}
```

### Possible Output:

```
Thread 1 updated value = 11
Thread 2 updated value = 13
```

👉 Both threads modified the same heap object, because heap memory is shared across threads.

---

### 🔹 Important note

Since multiple threads can access the same heap object **concurrently**, you need **synchronization** (like `std::mutex`) to avoid data races. Otherwise, you can get unpredictable results.

---

✅ So, in short:

- **Yes**: All threads in a process share dynamically allocated objects (`new`, `malloc`).
    
- **Yes**: They can all access the same instance.
    
- **But**: You must protect shared heap data with locks if multiple threads write at the same time.
    

---

Do you want me to also show you how the **same program behaves with `fork()` (process)**, so you can see that heap is _not_ shared there?

Good question 👍 Let’s sort this carefully.

When we talk about **threads in the same process**, we say:  
👉 "They share some things, but also keep some things private."

---

# 🔹 **What threads in the same process _share_**

- **Code segment (text)** → instructions of the program.
    
- **Heap** → dynamically allocated memory (`new`, `malloc`).
    
- **Global / static variables** → one copy, visible to all threads.
    
- **Open file descriptors / handles** → threads can read/write the same files, sockets, pipes.
    
- **Address space** → essentially, all memory regions except each thread’s private stack.
    

---

# 🔹 **What threads do _not_ share** (private per-thread)

- **Registers** → each thread has its own set (PC, SP, general-purpose registers).
    
- **Stack** → each thread has its own stack for local variables and function calls.
    
    - That’s why two threads can both call the same function but have different local variables.
        
- **Thread-local storage (TLS)** → variables explicitly marked to be per-thread.
    
- **Signal handling context** (partially shared, but delivery can be per-thread).
    
- **Thread-specific scheduling info** → priority, state (running, waiting).
    

---

# 🔹 Quick mental model

- A **process** = container with resources (memory, files, code).
    
- **Threads** = workers inside that container.
    
    - They **share the workshop** (heap, globals, files).
        
    - But each **has its own backpack** (stack, registers).
        

---

✅ So:

- **Shared** → Heap, globals, code, files, address space.
    
- **Not shared** → Stack, registers, thread-local data.
    

---

Do you want me to draw a small **ASCII diagram** showing memory layout with multiple threads so you can visualize exactly what’s shared vs private?
Yes ✅ you’ve nailed the intuition!

Let me polish it into a clean mental model:

---

### 🔹 Shared parts (the **"data/resources"** of the process)

- **Code (instructions)** → one copy for everyone.
    
- **Heap (dynamic memory)** → all threads can read/write the same objects.
    
- **Globals/statics** → one copy, all threads see it.
    
- **Files, sockets, devices** → shared handles.
    

👉 These are like the **common workshop tools** that all workers (threads) use.

---

### 🔹 Private parts (the **"execution machinery"** each thread needs)

- **Registers** → every thread has its own Program Counter (PC), Stack Pointer (SP), general-purpose registers.
    
- **Stack** → each thread’s local variables and function calls go here.
    
- **Thread-local storage** → optional per-thread variables.
    
- **Scheduling info** → state, priority, quantum for CPU.
    

👉 These are like the **personal notebooks and hands** of each worker — they can’t be shared, or else execution would clash.

---

### 🔹 Quick ASCII picture

```
Process Address Space
+-------------------------+  <- Shared Code (text segment)
|   Program Instructions  |
+-------------------------+  <- Shared Globals/Statics
|   Global Variables      |
+-------------------------+  
|   Heap (shared objects) |
+-------------------------+
|   Thread 1 Stack        | <- private
+-------------------------+
|   Thread 2 Stack        | <- private
+-------------------------+
|   Thread 3 Stack        | <- private
+-------------------------+
```

- All threads share the **upper parts** (code, globals, heap).
    
- Each thread gets its **own stack at the bottom** + private registers.
    

---

✅ So your summary is exactly right:

- **Data = shared.**
    
- **Execution context (stack, registers) = private.**
    

---

Do you want me to also contrast this with **processes (via `fork`)**, where even heap/globals are not shared? That way you’ll have a **full threads vs processes** picture.

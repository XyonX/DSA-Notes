Got it üëç The **system bootstrap process** is another common OS exam/interview topic. Let‚Äôs break it down in **clear steps + ASCII diagrams** for quick memory.

# ‚ö° System Bootstrap Process in Operating Systems

**Bootstrap = the process of starting up the computer and loading the operating system into memory**.  
The term comes from _‚Äúpulling yourself up by your own bootstraps‚Äù_ ‚Üí the computer starts with nothing but hardware and gradually loads the OS.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Power On**

- User presses the power button.
    
- The CPU is reset and starts execution at a **predefined memory location** (usually a fixed ROM address).
    
- Only minimal hardware is active.
    

---

### 2. **Execution of Firmware (BIOS/UEFI)**

- The CPU begins executing instructions from **firmware stored in ROM** (BIOS in old PCs, UEFI in modern systems).
    
- Firmware performs **POST (Power-On Self-Test)**:
    
    - Checks CPU, memory (RAM), keyboard, display, and other essential hardware.
        
    - If errors ‚Üí system halts or beeps error codes.
        

---

### 3. **Boot Loader Stage**

- Firmware looks for a **bootable device** (HDD/SSD, CD/DVD, USB, network).
    
- Reads the **boot sector (MBR in BIOS, EFI partition in UEFI)**.
    
- Loads a **small program called the Boot Loader** into memory.
    

Examples of boot loaders:

- **GRUB, LILO** (Linux)
    
- **Windows Boot Manager**
    

---

### 4. **Loading the Kernel**

- Boot loader loads the **Operating System kernel** into RAM.
    
- Kernel is usually stored in the **/boot directory** (Linux) or system partition (Windows).
    
- Kernel is decompressed and initialized.
    

---

### 5. **Kernel Initialization**

- Kernel sets up:
    
    - **Memory management** (page tables, virtual memory)
        
    - **Process management** (creates process 0 / idle task)
        
    - **Device drivers** for disk, keyboard, display, etc.
        
    - **Interrupts and system call interface**
        

---

### 6. **Starting System Processes**

- After the kernel is ready, it starts the **first user-space process**:
    
    - **init/systemd (Linux)**
        
    - **Session Manager (Windows)**
        
- These start background services (daemons in Linux, services in Windows).
    

---

### 7. **User Login**

- Finally, the system launches the **login program** (TTY in Linux, Winlogon in Windows).
    
- User can log in ‚Üí the system is fully operational.

## ‚ö° Quick One-Liner for Interview

- **Bootstrap = the process of turning on a system, running firmware (BIOS/UEFI), loading the boot loader, and finally starting the OS kernel + user processes.**

üëâ Do you want me to also explain the **difference in bootstrap between BIOS (MBR) and UEFI (GPT)** systems? That often comes up in OS interviews.

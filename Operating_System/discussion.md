## Operating System Topics

## os_roadmap
- Comprehensive roadmap for studying operating systems, including why OS topics are important in interviews and a full list of topics to study.
- This covers the foundational knowledge needed for understanding how operating systems work and why they're critical for system design and performance optimization.
- Key areas include basics, processes/threads, scheduling, synchronization, deadlocks, memory management, and advanced topics.

## os_basics
- Fundamental concepts of operating systems including definitions, types of OS, kernel vs. user mode, and system bootstrap process.
- Covers the basic functions of an OS, different types (Batch, Multi-Programmed, Time-Sharing, Distributed, Real-Time), and the difference between kernel and user mode.
- Important for understanding how the OS acts as an intermediary between user and hardware.

## os_processes_threads
- Detailed coverage of processes and threads including states, PCB, differences between processes and threads, context switching, and multithreading models.
- Explains process lifecycle, Process Control Block components, zombie/orphan processes, and the benefits of multithreading.
- Covers both descriptive concepts and MCQ-style questions that are commonly asked in interviews.

## os_process_scheduling
- CPU scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Multi-Level Queue/Feedback scheduling.
- Differentiates between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling, and explains the role of different types of schedulers.
- Covers scheduling criteria like CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

## os_synchronization
- Synchronization mechanisms including critical sections, race conditions, semaphores, mutexes, and the producer-consumer problem.
- Explains the critical section problem and its requirements (mutual exclusion, progress, bounded waiting).
- Covers both software solutions (Peterson's algorithm) and hardware solutions (test-and-set instructions).

## os_deadlocks
- Deadlock concepts including necessary conditions, prevention, avoidance (Banker's algorithm), detection, and recovery methods.
- Explains the four Coffman conditions and strategies for deadlock prevention.
- Covers resource allocation graphs and safe/unsafe states in the context of deadlock avoidance.

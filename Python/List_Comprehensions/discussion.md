# List Comprehensions - Discussion

## 3d_coordinates_filter
- Generate valid coordinate triplets in a 3D space excluding a specific constraint surface defined by i + j + k != n.
- Uses nested list comprehensions to generate all possible combinations and filter them based on the constraint.
- This approach is more concise and Pythonic compared to using nested loops.

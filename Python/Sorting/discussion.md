# Sorting - Discussion

## runner_up_score
- Find the second-highest score (runner-up score) from a list of scores.
- Uses set to remove duplicates, then converts to list and sorts to find the second highest element.
- This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in functions for a clean solution.

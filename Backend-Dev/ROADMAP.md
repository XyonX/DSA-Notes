### Backend Developer Skills Roadmap Checklist

This is a structured ticklist based on essential and advanced backend skills. Start with the foundational ones (marked as "Core") and progress to advanced ("Advanced"). Use it to track your learningâ€”check off as you gain proficiency through projects, courses, or practice.

#### 1. Programming Languages
- [ ] Master Node.js (async programming, promises, async/await, error handling) **Core**
- [ ] Learn TypeScript for type safety in Node.js **Core**
- [ ] Explore Python (e.g., with Flask or Django) **Advanced**
- [ ] Learn Go for performance-focused applications **Advanced**

#### 2. Web Frameworks and APIs
- [ ] Deepen Express.js (middleware, routing, validation, HTTP basics) **Core**
- [ ] Understand REST API design principles (methods, status codes, idempotency) **Core**
- [ ] Implement GraphQL (e.g., with Apollo Server) **Advanced**
- [ ] Experiment with gRPC for efficient APIs **Advanced**
- [ ] Try NestJS for structured Node.js development **Advanced**

#### 3. Databases
- [ ] SQL fundamentals (queries, joins, indexing) with PostgreSQL or MySQL **Core**
- [ ] NoSQL basics with MongoDB **Core**
- [ ] Use ORMs like Sequelize/Prisma (SQL) or Mongoose (MongoDB) **Advanced**
- [ ] Database optimization (sharding, replication, ACID vs. BASE) **Advanced**
- [ ] Integrate caching with Redis **Advanced**
- [ ] Explore time-series databases like InfluxDB **Advanced**

#### 4. Server and Deployment
- [ ] Nginx for reverse proxy, load balancing, static serving **Core**
- [ ] Containerization with Docker **Core**
- [ ] Orchestration with Kubernetes (e.g., deploy to Minikube) **Advanced**
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or Jenkins) **Advanced**
- [ ] Deploy to cloud platforms (AWS EC2/Lambda/S3 or GCP) **Advanced**

#### 5. Security and Authentication
- [ ] Implement JWT for token-based authentication **Core**
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt **Core**
- [ ] Address OWASP Top 10 (e.g., prevent SQL injection) **Core**
- [ ] Integrate OAuth2/OpenID Connect (e.g., Google auth) **Advanced**
- [ ] Handle rate limiting, CORS, and HTTPS **Advanced**
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) **Advanced**
- [ ] Use secrets management (e.g., Vault or environment variables) **Advanced**

#### 6. Scalability and Performance
- [ ] Basic caching and load testing (e.g., Redis, Artillery) **Core**
- [ ] Message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka for async tasks **Advanced**
- [ ] Design microservices architecture **Advanced**
- [ ] Monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana or ELK stack **Advanced**

#### 7. Testing and Best Practices
- [ ] Unit/integration testing (Jest or Mocha for APIs) **Core**
- [ ] End-to-end testing (e.g., Supertest) **Advanced**
- [ ] Code quality tools (ESLint, Semantic Versioning) **Advanced**
- [ ] Git workflows and design patterns (MVC, Dependency Injection) **Advanced**

#### 8. Additional Skills for Interviews
- [ ] Data structures and algorithms (arrays, maps, trees; sorting, searching) **Core**
- [ ] System design problems (e.g., URL shortener, scalable chat app) **Advanced**
- [ ] Real-time features with WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) **Advanced**
- [ ] Serverless architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda) **Advanced**
- [ ] Trends like edge computing **Advanced**

Build projects to apply these (e.g., a full-stack app on GitHub) and practice explaining trade-offs in interviews. Revisit this list periodically to track progress!

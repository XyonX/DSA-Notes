# DSA-Notes

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) notes and code, created to support my learning as a BTech CSE student. It serves as a personal resource for preparing for technical job interviews, practicing coding skills, and keeping records for future reference.

## Structure
- `recent_codes.txt`: Where I dump new code snippets for processing.
- `logs/`: Daily logs of coding activities (e.g., `2025-07-19.md`).
- `progress.md`: Tracks problem status (solved, attempted, unsolved).
- Topic folders (e.g., `Strings/`):
  - `problems/`: Contains problem-specific code (`code.cpp`) and notes (`notes.md`).
  - `compact_version.md`: Summarizes solutions.
  - `discussion.md`: Detailed problem discussions.

## Usage
- I add code to `recent_codes.txt`, and Gemini CLI organizes it into topic folders, updates notes, logs activities, and commits changes to Git.
- The repo is maintained for personal study and potential career switches.

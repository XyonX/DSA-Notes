probability maths



1.a box has 6 black , 4 red , 2 white and 3 blue shirt , whwn 2 shiirts are picked randomy , what is the probability that either both are white or both are blue

ans=> 
intuition->
either both are whuite or both are blue so
=> prbaility of 2 being white + proobability of 2 being blue
=> probability of 2 being white = probalility of 1 being white * after pciking 1 probability of that being white
=>  probability of 2 being white =total white/total ball *after total white /total ball = 2/15*1/14 

=>  probability of 2 being blue = probalility of 1 being blue * after pciking 1 probability of that being blue
=> probability of 2 being blue = total blue/total ball * after picking 1 bue  total white /total ball = 3/15*2/14

=> answet = probalith of being 2 shirt eiher blue or white = probability of 2 beinng white or 2 being blue =probalith of being 2 shirt eiher blue or white = probability of 2 beinng white + 2 being blue=(2/15*1/14) +(3/15*2/14)



=>key points
here we dont replace the shirt so tahts why we reduce the shit by 1

2.a pot has 22 white ,, 6 black , 4 grey , 8 green balls , if one ball is picked randomly from the pot, waht is the probbility of it being black or ggreen
ans=> easy to solve
probability or it beig blakc or green = probability or being black + probality of it being green
prob of it beig black = total blakc /totla = 6/20
pro of it beig green = total green / total = 8/20
probability or it beig blakc or green = 6/20 + 8/20 = 14/20 = 7/10



3.There are 2 pots. One pot has 5 red and 3 green marbles. Other has 4 red and 2 green marbles. What is the probability of drawing a red marble?
=> now to find the answer we need to consider two thign first the red can come from any of the pot 
so the answer is =  finding red from either pot a or pot b
probability of ball being rred = red from pot1 or red from pot2= probaltity of ball beig red from pot 1 +  probaltity of ball beig red from pot 2
the porbbilit of the ball beig red from pot 1 = the pot being 1 and the ball being red = the probability of pot being pot1* ball being red from pot1 = 1/2*5/8
the porbbilit of the ball beig red from pot 2 = the pot being 2 and the ball being red = the probability of pot being pot2* ball being red from pot2 = 1/2*4/6
probability of ball being rred=(1/2*5/8)+(1/2*4/6)=31/48

=>notes here the evetn is sequenctial for like beig the ball from pot 1 hete its a and evetn so the first ting is the point beig pot 1 then at the same time (and) the ball being red


4.In a set of 30 game cards, 17 are white and rest are green. 4 white and 5 green are marked IMPORTANT. If a card is chosen randomly from this set, what is the possibility of choosing a green card or an ‘IMPORTANT’ card?

=>choosing  green card or importent card = prb of car beign ggreen + probcar beig importent 
we can solve the   answer in two way by doing a bit more lacuation like prob of card beiging gren = 13/30 now to calcuatlethe pro of card being imp we can remvoe the green card and do the cal like 13/30+4/5 or we can simpley  do 13/10+9/30 - 5/30(for hte imp we taking all the imp then removign the green impo card
so ans = prob of car bing green + prob of card being imp= (13/30+9/30)-5/30= 17/30(5/30 is subtracted to eliiinate the diuble counting)

5.A box has 6 black, 4 red, 2 white and 3 blue shirts. Find the probability of drawing 2 black shirts if they are picked randomly?
prob of being 2 shirt being blac = firr 1 being black and seocnd 1 being black = prob of first one being black * pprob of second one being black = num /black /total * num black/total(after sub1 as e already choose one blacl)= 6/15*5/14 =1/7


6.A box has 6 black, 4 red, 2 white and 3 blue shirts. What is the probability that 2 red shirts and 1 blue shirt get chosen during a random selection of 3 shirts from the box?
ans=>this wuestion is really interesting 
so we need tofingd the probability getting 2 red shirt and 1 blue shirt 
now here is the twist , we an eiter get 2 red and 1 blue tis way like first one blue second one blue and tird one red or first one ble sencd one red and third one blue or varous otehr way
as its or we will need to add the probability of thse 
now hwat is tis how would you knw in how many way you can get 2 red ad 1 blue shirt , here comes the concet of permuation
we have 3 elemnt in set {red, red,blue} or if we make a int rep {1,1,2} so in genral the permuation of 3 elemnt is 3! or 6 now here 2 are reperat so we didide by 2 so 3!/1! =3 way or the ways are 1 ,1,2 or ,1,2,1 or 2,1,1 now if we go turn to color it will be red ,red,blue or red ,blue ,red, or blue ,red,red 
so we need to calcalte the probabilty of finding 2 red and 1 in blue this 3 order as eiithe any of them can take us to the answer so its an or operation so +
so the ans =prob of getting 2 red and blue in tis order(red ,red,blue) + in thhis order (red ,blue ,red) + in tis order( blue ,red,red)
for the probability in this order , (red ,red,blue) = 4/15 *3/14*3/13
for the probability in this order , (red ,blue,red) = 4/15 *3/14*3/13
for the probability in this order , (blue,red,red) = 3/15 *4/14*3/13
now among of theese sny of the pat hwill take us  to the answe so he naswe is adding them = ( 4/15 *3/14*3/13)+(4/15 *3/14*3/13)+(3/15 *4/14*3/13)=18/455

//the optimal way of soving this remvoe nth node from end
// we take the approach of moving the fast ahead of slot nth step so that while the fast reaches end node the slow reached the nth node 
//now here some of the ccah are to remvoe the nth node we dont need t ogo till nth rater the pre node than we can streo the  next not in a temp and move the slow->next as slow->next->next wihc will simply rmeove adn we can  take the node in a temp and delelte it
//i solve thi but i took help as i was having bug
//i need to be solvign this again thinkign bout the count and till wehre to go as its odne now but i nneed to make this intuion more clear or till the indices 
///i dint clear the edge caes too like the n might be larger that thesize of the ll or the nthe ndoe cound be the last node

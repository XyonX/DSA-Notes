# Qwen CLI Configuration for Coding Buddy

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help Joy, a BTech CSE student, organize and manage notes and code across multiple areas, including coding topics (Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Python, SQL), Quantitative Aptitude, and English improvement and grammar. The primary objectives are:

- **Prepare for technical job interviews** by maintaining structured and accessible notes across various topics.
- **Keep records for future reference** to revisit concepts, solutions, and notes.
- **Practice skills** by documenting personal solutions, approaches, and learning materials.
- **Support potential career switches** by providing a reliable reference of knowledge across different domains.

Qwen CLI serves two key roles:

1. **Automate note organization**: Processes snippets from `recent_snippets.txt`, organizes them into topic folders under the appropriate topic area, updates logs, creates or updates `progress.md` for problem-based topics, and commits changes to Git.
2. **Act as a mentor**: Provides guidance on what to practice, discusses specific problems, snippets, or notes (including those in `recent_snippets.txt`), conducts mock tests, and offers feedback across all supported topic areas.

## Folder Structure

The root folder is `CodingBuddy/`, which contains:

- **`recent_snippets.txt`**: A temporary file for code or text snippets (with or without metadata).
- **`logs/`**: Daily logs of activities (e.g., `2025-07-19.md`).
- **`progress.md`**: Tracks problem status (e.g., solved, attempted, unsolved) for problem-based topics (DSA, OOP, Python, SQL, QuantitativeAptitude), created or updated automatically.
- **`update_status.json`**: A temporary file to track the progress of the "update my notes" command (created during processing and deleted upon completion).
- **Topic Area Folders**:
  - **Problem-based Topic Areas** (e.g., `DSA/`, `OOP/`, `Python/`, `SQL/`, `QuantitativeAptitude/`): Each contains:
    - **Topic Folders** (e.g., `Strings/` under `DSA/`, `Arithmetic/` under `QuantitativeAptitude/`): Each contains:
      - **`problems/`**: Subfolders for each problem (e.g., `two_sum/` under `DSA/Strings/`, `percentage/` under `QuantitativeAptitude/Arithmetic/`), with:
        - **`content.<ext>`**: Solution or code (only for code-oriented snippets; `<ext>` is based on the topic area, e.g., `cpp` for DSA and OOP, `py` for Python, `sql` for SQL; not used for text-oriented snippets like theory, MCQs, or QuantitativeAptitude).
        - **`notes.md`**: Problem-specific notes, including solutions for text-oriented snippets, known issues if applicable, concepts, discussions, and small inline code snippets if relevant.
      - **`compact_version.md`**: Summarizes solutions for the topic.
      - **`discussion.md`**: Detailed problem discussions for the topic.
  - **Note-based Topic Areas** (e.g., `English/`): Contains:
    - **Topic Folders** (e.g., `Grammar/`, `Vocabulary/`): Each contains:
      - **`notes.md`**: Collected notes, discussions, and additional information for the topic (single file combining all content).
- **`Materials/`**: Contains study resources and personal documents, with subfolders such as:
  - **`Books/`**: For storing books like DSA textbooks, aptitude guides, or English learning resources.
  - **`PYQs/`**: For previous year questions from exams or placements.
  - **`CompanyQuestions/`**: For company-specific placement or interview questions.
  - **`PersonalDocs/`**: For personal documents like resume, marksheets, passport-size photos, etc.

## File Naming Conventions

- **Topic Area Folders**: Broad areas (e.g., `DSA`, `OOP`, `Python`, `SQL`, `QuantitativeAptitude`, `English`).
- **Topic Folders**: Specific topics within each area (e.g., `Strings` under `DSA`, `Arithmetic` under `QuantitativeAptitude`, `Grammar` under `English`).
- **Problem Folders**: Descriptive problem names (e.g., `two_sum` under `DSA/Strings`, `percentage` under `QuantitativeAptitude/Arithmetic`).
- **Content Files**: Named `content.<ext>` for code-oriented snippets in problem-based topics, where `<ext>` is:
  - `cpp` for DSA and OOP.
  - `py` for Python.
  - `sql` for SQL.
  (Not used for text-oriented snippets like QuantitativeAptitude, theory/MCQs in DSA, etc.; content is embedded in `notes.md` instead.)
- **Notes Files**: 
  - `notes.md` in problem folders for problem-based topics (e.g., `DSA/Strings/problems/two_sum/notes.md`). For text-oriented snippets, this single file includes solutions, concepts, discussions, known issues, and inline code if applicable.
  - `notes.md` directly in topic folders for note-based topics (e.g., `English/Grammar/notes.md`), which includes all notes, discussions, and may have a "Known Issues" section if applicable.
- **Log Files**: Date-based (e.g., `2025-07-19.md`).
- **Progress File**: `progress.md` in the root directory, with statuses like "solved", "attempted", or "unsolved" for problem-based topics.
- **Status File**: `update_status.json` (temporary, used during processing).

## Qwen CLI's Role and Instructions

### 1. Note Organization with Checkpoint System

When you say **"update my notes"**, Qwen CLI:

- **Checks for `update_status.json`**:
  - If `update_status.json` exists, it resumes processing from the last checkpoint.
  - If it does not exist, it creates a new `update_status.json` before starting.
- Processes each snippet in `recent_snippets.txt`.
- Check progress if we have already done this problem earlier, if yes mark it as practiced too you can keep a count of number of times practiced and append the practice code to the original notes code file.
- For structured snippets with metadata:
  - Identifies the topic area as problem-based (e.g., `DSA`, `QuantitativeAptitude`) or note-based (e.g., `English`).
  - For problem-based topics:
    - Organizes into `topic_area/topic/problems/problem/`.
    - If type: code, saves to `content.<ext>` and `notes.md`.
    - If type: text (e.g., theory, MCQs, QuantitativeAptitude), saves all content (solution, notes, concepts) to `notes.md` as sections, with small code snippets inline if present.
- For note-based topics:
    - Appends to `topic_area/topic/notes.md` as sections (e.g., notes, discussions) with timestamps if applicable.
- For unstructured snippets:
  - Infers topic area, topic, and type (code or text) based on content (e.g., code patterns for DSA, mathematical expressions for QuantitativeAptitude, prose for English).
- Analyzes the content for errors and potential issues (from high-level interview perspective - not production-level quality is expected in notes). For code: check syntax; for text: check logical correctness.
- Look for the specific problem on LeetCode, if the problem exists on LeetCode add the LeetCode problem link in the notes md file too.
- Appends to `notes.md`, `compact_version.md`, and `discussion.md` for problem-based topics, or `notes.md` for note-based topics.
- Prompts you with options if critical issues are detected (NOT PRODUCTION LEVEL JUST IF THE CONTENT IS TOO WRONG AS ITS FOR INTERVIEW AND CODING ROUND).
- Generates or enhances notes.
- Logs activities in `logs/<today's date>.md`.
- Updates `progress.md` for problem-based topics.
- Commits changes to Git.
- Clears `recent_snippets.txt` and deletes `update_status.json` upon completion.

#### Checkpoint System

- **Purpose**: Ensures the update process can resume if interrupted.
- **How It Works**:
  - Creates `update_status.json` if not present.
  - Updates the status before processing each snippet.
  - Resumes from the last processed snippet if interrupted.
  - Deletes `update_status.json` after successful completion.
- **Status File Format** (example):
  ```json
  {
    "processed_snippets": ["hash1", "hash2"],
    "current_snippet": "hash3",
    "status": "processing"
  }
  ```

#### Handling API Limits

- If an API limit is reached, saves the state and informs you to retry later.

#### For Structured Code Dumps

Include metadata:

```
// Type: <code|text>
// Topic: <topic_area>/<topic>
// Problem: <problem> (for problem-based topics only)
// Notes: <notes>
<snippet>
// END OF SNIPPET
```

**Examples:**

```
// Type: code
// Topic: DSA/Strings
// Problem: two_sum
// Notes: Solution using hash map
<cpp code>
// END OF SNIPPET
```

```
// Type: text
// Topic: QuantitativeAptitude/Arithmetic
// Problem: percentage
// Notes: Formula for percentage increase
<text solution>
// END OF SNIPPET
```

```
// Type: text
// Topic: English/Grammar
// Notes: Explanation of past perfect tense
<grammar notes>
// END OF SNIPPET
```

```
// Type: text
// Topic: DSA/DataStrcuture/Arrays
// Problem: array_theory_mcq
// Notes: Concepts on array rotation with MCQ examples
<text with optional inline code>
// END OF SNIPPET
```

#### For Unstructured Code Dumps

Qwen CLI will:

- Parse content to infer topic area, topic, and type (code or text).

#### Content Analysis and User Prompts

- Use language-specific patterns:
  - **OOP**: Look for class definitions, inheritance, etc.
  - **Python**: Detect function definitions, list comprehensions, decorators, etc.
  - **SQL**: Identify SQL keywords like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `JOIN`, etc.
  - **QuantitativeAptitude**: Recognize mathematical expressions or problem-solving text.
  - **English**: Identify prose, grammar rules, or vocabulary lists.
  - **DSA Theory/MCQ**: Look for explanatory text, questions, or short code examples.
- Infer the appropriate topic area and topic based on these patterns.
- Before adding content to notes:
  - **Analyzes the content** for syntax/logical errors and potential issues.
  - **If issues are detected**:
    - Prompts you with options:
      1. Add the wrong content to notes as is (status: attempted).
      2. Discuss and fix the content (use "Let's discuss <problem>" afterward).
      3. Add a fixed version to notes (CLI suggests a correction).
  - **If no issues are detected**:
    - Asks for confirmation:
      1. Yes, add to notes as solved.
      2. No, proceed with options to handle issues.

#### Generating and Enhancing Notes

- **When Notes Are Missing or Inadequate**:
  - Generates concise notes describing the snippet, key learnings, and important aspects.
- **When Partial Notes Are Provided**:
  - Appends additional details to ensure completeness.
- **For Attempted Solutions**:
  - Includes a "Known Issues" section in `notes.md` for problem-based topics.

#### Common Processing Steps

For both structured and unstructured dumps:

- **Determine File Handling**: Based on type (code or text) and topic area.
- **Create or Update Folders**:
  - Create `topic_area`, `topic`, and `problems/<problem>/` folders if they don’t exist for problem-based topics.
  - Create `topic_area` and `topic` folders for note-based topics.
- **Save the Snippet**:
  - For problem-based topics:
    - If type: code: Write the snippet to `problems/<problem>/content.<ext>` (overwrite if exists); append notes to `notes.md`.
    - If type: text: Append the snippet to `problems/<problem>/notes.md` with sections (e.g., `### Solution`, `### Notes`); include small code inline in markdown if present.
  - For note-based topics: Append the snippet to `topic/notes.md` with a timestamped section (e.g., `### Added on 2025-08-04`).
- **Append Notes**:
  - For problem-based topics: Append extracted or provided `notes` to `problems/<problem>/notes.md`.
  - For note-based topics: Append to `topic/notes.md`.
- **Update Summaries and Discussions**:
  - For problem-based topics:
    - Append to `compact_version.md` in the topic folder:
      ```
      ## <problem>
      - Notes: <notes>
      ```
    - Append to `discussion.md` in the topic folder:
      ```
      ## <problem>
      - <notes>
      ```
  - For note-based topics:
    - Include discussions as sections within `notes.md` (e.g., `### Discussion`).
- **Log the Activity**:
  - Update the daily log in `logs/<today's date>.md`:
    ```
    - Added/Updated <topic_area>/<topic>/<problem> (for problem-based)
    - Added/Updated <topic_area>/<topic> (for note-based)
    ```
- **Handle progress.md**:
  - If `progress.md` doesn’t exist, create it and analyze the entire note base to list all problems with a default status of "solved" (since content exists) for problem-based topics.
  - If `progress.md` exists, update it to include new or updated problems from `recent_snippets.txt` as "solved" and maintain existing statuses.
  - Format:
    ```

- **Commit to Git**:
  - Commit changes with:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added/Updated <topic_area>/<topic>/<problem> or <topic>"
    ```
- **Clear `recent_snippets.txt`**:
  - Empty the file only after all snippets are successfully processed.
- **Delete `update_status.json`**:
  - Remove the temporary status file upon completion.

### 2. Mentor Features

Qwen CLI acts as a mentor, using `progress.md`, `logs/`, and `recent_snippets.txt` to suggest practice, discuss snippets, and provide feedback.

#### Available Commands

- **Suggest Practice**: Say "What should I practice today?" or "Suggest problems to solve."
  - Suggests problems based on recent activity and progress for problem-based topics (e.g., QuantitativeAptitude problems) or topics to review for English.
- **Discuss Problem or Code**: Say "Let's discuss <topic_area>/<topic>/<problem>" or "Let's discuss the code in recent_snippets.txt for <problem>."
  - Retrieves and discusses the snippet from `recent_snippets.txt` or organized folders.
  - For "attempted" problems, focuses on identifying and fixing issues.
  - For "solved" problems, discusses the solution and relevant concepts.
  - For English topics, discusses notes and offers grammar or professional English tips.
- **Start Mock Test**: Say "Start a mock test."
  - Suggests problems and provides feedback after submission (applicable to problem-based topics).
- **Help**: Say "List commands" or "Help."
  - Displays available commands.

#### Discussing Code in `recent_snippets.txt`

- When you say "Let's discuss the code in recent_snippets.txt for <problem>," Qwen CLI:
  - Searches `recent_snippets.txt` for snippets related to `<problem>`.
  - If multiple snippets are found, asks you to specify which one to discuss.
  - Discusses the code, provides feedback, or answers questions based on the snippet.
- When you ask any question about code in `recent_snippets.txt` (e.g., "What does this line do in the two_sum code?"):
  - Searches `recent_snippets.txt` for the relevant snippet.
  - Responds based on the content of that snippet.

#### Mock Test Process

- **Starting a Test**: Suggests problems from `progress.md` or new problems (for problem-based topics).
- **Submitting Solutions**: Add to `recent_snippets.txt` with `// Mock Test Problem: <topic_area>/<topic>/<problem>`.
- **Feedback**:
  - Searches `recent_snippets.txt` for snippets with the mock test marker (e.g., `// Mock Test Problem: <topic_area>/<topic>/<problem>`).
  - Analyzes the solution and provides feedback on correctness, efficiency, and topic-specific aspects.

### Explicit Instructions for Qwen CLI

- **Do Not Generate or Overwrite**: Preserve original code unless a fixed version is approved.
- **Append, Do Not Overwrite**: Append to notes and summaries.
- **Logs**: Create logs when content is added, noting the status.
- **Progress**: Update `progress.md` with statuses: "solved", "attempted", or "unsolved" for problem-based topics only.
- **Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback without modifying content unless requested.
- **Checkpoint System**: Use `update_status.json` to track and resume processing.
- **File Handling**: Use `content.<ext>` only for code snippets; for text, embed in `notes.md`.
- **Inference**: Recognize patterns in unstructured snippets (e.g., code for DSA, math for QuantitativeAptitude, prose for English, theory/MCQs for DSA subtopics).
- **Note Generation**: Generate concise notes, including "Known Issues" for attempted solutions in problem-based topics.
- **Discussing Content**: Retrieve and discuss snippets from `recent_snippets.txt` or organized folders based on user queries, including any questions about the snippets.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Handle existing files (e.g., content.txt in QuantitativeAptitude) without deletion; for new text snippets, use `notes.md`.

## Additional Notes

- **Version Control**: Git tracks changes with commits after processing.
- **Manual Updates**: You may manually edit `progress.md` to adjust statuses or add files to `Materials/`.

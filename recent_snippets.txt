Circular Linked List
A circular linked list is a linked list where the last node’s next points back to the head, forming a loop.

Uses:

Round-robin scheduling

Circular buffers

Repeatedly cycling through elements (e.g., multiplayer games)

Difference from normal linked list:

Normal list ends with null; circular list loops back to head

Traversal in circular list can go on indefinitely without stoppingCircular Linked List

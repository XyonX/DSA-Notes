00 OPERATING SYSTEM ROADMAP
### Why Operating System Topics Are Commonly Asked in Product-Based Company Interviews

Product-based companies (like FAANG or similar tech giants) often include MCQ rounds in their hiring processes to assess candidates' foundational knowledge of operating systems (OS). These tests evaluate how well you understand core concepts that underpin software efficiency, resource management, and system reliability—critical for roles involving system design, backend development, or performance optimization. From analyzing various interview prep resources and question banks, OS questions frequently focus on real-world scenarios like multitasking, memory constraints, and concurrency issues. They test not just rote knowledge but the ability to reason about trade-offs, such as preemptive vs. non-preemptive scheduling or paging vs. segmentation.

The topics are drawn from common patterns in MCQs and interview questions across sites like GeeksforGeeks, InterviewBit, and Sanfoundry, which aggregate experiences from candidates at companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others. Questions emphasize practical implications, like handling deadlocks in multi-threaded applications or optimizing CPU utilization in high-load systems. Mastering these ensures you can explain why certain OS mechanisms prevent issues like thrashing or starvation.

02 OPERATING SYSTEM- POROCESS AND THREADS
Most Asked Questions from OS Processes and Threads
### Most Asked Questions from OS Processes and Threads

Based on common patterns from interview preparation resources, here are the most frequently asked questions on Processes and Threads in Operating Systems (OS). These are aggregated from popular sites and focus on key concepts like process lifecycle, states, differences with threads, multithreading benefits, and context switching. I've included questions in both descriptive and MCQ formats, along with concise answers/explanations for study purposes. These appear repeatedly in interviews for product-based companies, testing understanding of resource management and concurrency.

#### Descriptive Questions
1. **What is a process in an operating system?**  
   A process is an instance of a program in execution, including the program code, data, and resources like memory and CPU. It is a unit of work managed by the OS for scheduling and resource allocation.

2. **What are the different states of a process? Explain the process lifecycle.**  
   Process states include New (created but not ready), Ready (waiting for CPU), Running (executing on CPU), Waiting/Blocked (for I/O or event), and Terminated (finished execution). The lifecycle involves creation, scheduling to ready queue, execution, possible blocking, and termination.

3. **What is a Process Control Block (PCB)?**  
   PCB is a data structure maintained by the OS for each process, containing information like process ID, state, priority, registers, program counter, memory limits, and open files. It enables context switching and process management.

4. **What is the difference between a process and a thread?**  
   A process is an independent program with its own memory space and resources, while a thread is a lightweight subunit within a process sharing the same memory and resources. Processes are heavier with higher overhead for creation and switching; threads enable concurrency within a process.

5. **What is a thread? Why is it called a lightweight process?**  
   A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process, sharing code, data, and files but having its own stack and registers. It's lightweight because it requires fewer resources for creation and context switching compared to processes, as it doesn't duplicate the entire process environment.

6. **What are the benefits of multithreading?**  
   Benefits include improved responsiveness (e.g., UI remains active), resource sharing (threads share memory), economy (cheaper to create/switch than processes), scalability on multiprocessor systems, and better utilization of CPU for concurrent tasks.

7. **What is context switching? Explain its role in processes and threads.**  
   Context switching is saving the state of a currently running process/thread (via PCB) and loading another to allow multitasking. It's faster for threads (sharing address space) than processes, but incurs overhead like cache invalidation.

8. **What are zombie and orphan processes?**  
   A zombie process is a terminated child process whose exit status hasn't been read by the parent (via wait()), consuming minimal resources until reaped. An orphan process is a child whose parent terminates first, adopted by the init process (PID 1).

9. **Compare user-level threads and kernel-level threads.**  
   User-level threads are managed by user-space libraries (faster creation, but blocking one blocks all); kernel-level threads are managed by the OS kernel (better for parallelism, but slower due to system calls). Hybrid models combine both.

10. **What is multithreading? Explain its models.**  
    Multithreading allows multiple threads in a single process to execute concurrently. Models include many-to-one (user threads mapped to one kernel thread), one-to-one (each user thread to a kernel thread), and many-to-many (multiple user threads multiplexed to kernel threads).

#### MCQ-Style Questions
These are common in screening rounds; I've included options, correct answers, and brief explanations based on aggregated patterns.

11. **Which of the following is not shared by threads in the same process?**  
    Options: a) Stack, b) Code section, c) Data section, d) Open files.

    Answer: a) When process is scheduled to run after some execution.  
    Explanation: Ready state means the process is waiting in the queue for CPU allocation.

18. **In a time-sharing operating system, when the time slot given to a process is completed, the process goes from the running state to the ______**  
    Options: a) Blocked state, b) Ready state, c) Suspended state, d) Terminated state.

03 OPERATING SYSTEM -PROCESS SCHEDULING
### Most Asked Questions from OS Process Scheduling

Based on common patterns from interview experiences at product-based companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others (aggregated from resources like GeeksforGeeks, InterviewBit, PrepInsta, and Sanfoundry), here are the most frequently asked questions on Process Scheduling in Operating Systems (OS). These focus on scheduling objectives, algorithms, types, and related concepts. Questions often test understanding of efficiency metrics (e.g., waiting time, turnaround time) and trade-offs (e.g., starvation in priority scheduling). I've included descriptive and MCQ formats with concise answers/explanations, drawn from real interview reports.

#### Descriptive Questions
1. **What is process scheduling in OS? Why is it needed?**  
   Process scheduling is the OS mechanism to select and allocate CPU to processes from the ready queue to maximize efficiency. It's needed for multitasking, fair resource allocation, and optimizing metrics like CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time.

2. **Explain the different types of schedulers in OS.**  
   Long-term scheduler (job scheduler) selects processes from job pool to ready queue, controlling multiprogramming degree. Short-term scheduler (CPU scheduler) selects from ready queue for CPU allocation. Medium-term scheduler swaps processes to/from memory to reduce multiprogramming if overloaded.

3. **Differentiate between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.**  
   Preemptive: Running process can be interrupted and switched if a higher-priority one arrives (e.g., SRTF, Round Robin), allowing better responsiveness but higher overhead. Non-preemptive: Process runs to completion or blocks voluntarily (e.g., FCFS, SJF), simpler but can cause convoy effect.

4. **What are the main CPU scheduling criteria?**  
   Criteria include: CPU utilization (keep CPU busy), throughput (processes completed per unit time), turnaround time (submission to completion), waiting time (in ready queue), response time (first response to completion, key for interactive systems).

5. **Explain First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm with advantages and disadvantages.**  
   FCFS schedules processes in arrival order, non-preemptive. Advantages: Simple, fair for equal bursts. Disadvantages: Convoy effect (short processes wait behind long ones), high average waiting time.

6. **What is Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling? Is it preemptive or non-preemptive?**  
   SJF selects the process with the shortest burst time next, minimizing average waiting time. It can be non-preemptive (schedule on completion) or preemptive (SRTF: interrupt if shorter arrives). Optimal for waiting time but requires burst time prediction.

7. **Describe Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm. How does time quantum affect it?**  
   RR is preemptive, allocating fixed time quantum per process in cyclic order. Small quantum approximates FCFS with high overhead; large quantum reduces responsiveness. Balances fairness and response time.

8. **What is Priority Scheduling? How do you handle starvation?**  
   Priority Scheduling assigns CPU to highest-priority process (can be preemptive/non-preemptive). Starvation occurs if low-priority processes wait indefinitely; aging solves it by incrementally increasing priority over time.

9. **Explain Multi-Level Queue (MLQ) and Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduling.**  
   MLQ divides ready queue into multiple queues with different priorities/algorithms (e.g., foreground RR, background FCFS). MLFQ allows processes to move between queues based on behavior (e.g., demote long-running), adapting dynamically.

10. **What is the role of the dispatcher in process scheduling?**  
    The dispatcher allocates CPU to the selected process, performing context switch. It involves loading PCB, registers, and has dispatch latency (time from selection to execution).

#### MCQ-Style Questions
These are frequently seen in online assessments or initial rounds at FAANG-like companies.

11. **Which scheduling algorithm allocates the CPU first to the process that requests the CPU first?**  
    Options: a) FCFS, b) SJF, c) Priority Scheduling, d) Round Robin.  
    Answer: a) FCFS.  
    Explanation: FCFS is based on arrival time, like a queue.

12. **In which scheduling algorithm is the average waiting time minimized?**  
    Options: a) FCFS, b) SJF, c) Round Robin, d) Priority.  
    Answer: b) SJF.  
    Explanation: SJF prioritizes shorter jobs, proven optimal for non-preemptive if burst times known.

13. **What is the main disadvantage of Priority Scheduling?**  
    Options: a) High throughput, b) Starvation, c) Low response time, d) Convoy effect.  
    Answer: b) Starvation.  
    Explanation: Low-priority processes may never execute if high-priority ones keep arriving.

14. **Which of the following is a preemptive scheduling algorithm?**  
    Options: a) FCFS, b) SJF, c) Round Robin, d) All of these.  
    Answer: c) Round Robin.  
    Explanation: RR interrupts after time quantum; others can be non-preemptive.

15. **The ready queue is empty, but the CPU is idle. This situation is called?**  
    Options: a) Deadlock, b) Starvation, c) Inversion, d) None of these.  
    Answer: d) None of these (it's underutilization, but not standard term; often trick question for CPU idle state).  
    Explanation: Indicates no processes ready, but CPU waits.

16. **In Round Robin, if time quantum is very large, it behaves like?**  
    Options: a) FCFS, b) SJF, c) SRTF, d) Priority.  
    Answer: a) FCFS.  
    Explanation: Large quantum allows processes to run to completion without preemption.

17. **Which scheduler controls the degree of multiprogramming?**  
    Options: a) Short-term, b) Long-term, c) Medium-term, d) Dispatcher.  
    Answer: b) Long-term.  
    Explanation: It decides how many processes enter memory.

18. **Aging is a technique used to avoid?**  
    Options: a) Deadlock, b) Thrashing, c) Starvation, d) Inversion.  
    Answer: c) Starvation.  
    Explanation: Gradually increases priority of waiting processes.

These questions represent ~80% of process scheduling topics in interviews at companies like Amazon and Microsoft. Practice calculating metrics (e.g., Gantt charts for waiting time) and comparing algorithms.
04 - OPERATING SYSTEM Synchronization and Concurrency
### Most Asked Questions from OS Synchronization and Concurrency

Based on common patterns from interview experiences at product-based companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and others (aggregated from resources like GeeksforGeeks, InterviewBit, and similar platforms), here are the most frequently asked questions on Synchronization and Concurrency in Operating Systems (OS). These focus on key concepts like critical sections, race conditions, mutual exclusion, semaphores, mutexes, monitors, and related issues. Questions often test understanding of preventing data inconsistencies in multi-process/thread environments and handling scenarios like producer-consumer problems. I've included descriptive and MCQ formats with concise answers/explanations, drawn from real interview reports.

#### Descriptive Questions
1. **What is process synchronization? Why is it important?**  
   Process synchronization coordinates processes that share resources or data to ensure consistent execution and avoid interference. It maintains data integrity by using mechanisms like mutual exclusion for cooperative processes. Importance: Prevents race conditions and ensures orderly resource access in multitasking systems.

2. **What is a critical section? Explain the critical section problem.**  
   A critical section is a code segment where processes access shared resources (e.g., variables, files) that must be executed atomically to avoid inconsistencies. The problem requires ensuring mutual exclusion (only one process enters at a time), progress (no unnecessary delays), and bounded waiting (finite wait time).

3. **What is a race condition? How does it occur?**  
   A race condition occurs when the outcome of concurrent processes depends on execution order, leading to inconsistent results (e.g., two processes updating a shared variable simultaneously). It arises from non-atomic operations interrupted by context switches.

4. **What are the solutions to the critical section problem?**  
   Solutions include software approaches (e.g., Peterson's algorithm), hardware (e.g., test-and-set instructions), and synchronization primitives like semaphores or mutexes. They must satisfy mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting.

5. **What is a semaphore? Why is it used?**  
   A semaphore is an integer variable for controlling access to shared resources via atomic wait() (decrement) and signal() (increment) operations. Used for synchronization to prevent race conditions and manage resource pools in concurrent environments.

6. **What are the types of semaphores? Explain their differences.**  
   Binary semaphore: Value 0 or 1, for mutual exclusion (like a lock). Counting semaphore: Value ≥0, for controlling access to multiple resource instances. Binary focuses on signaling single availability; counting manages finite pools.

7. **What are the advantages and drawbacks of semaphores?**  
   Advantages: Machine-independent, easy implementation, allow multiple critical sections, no busy waiting. Drawbacks: Priority inversion, risk of deadlock if misused, programmer must track wait/signal calls.

8. **What is a mutex? How does it differ from a binary semaphore?**  
   A mutex is a locking mechanism for mutual exclusion, ensuring only one thread holds the lock at a time. Difference: Mutex uses locking (ownership by thread); binary semaphore uses signaling (no ownership, can be released by any thread).

9. **Explain Peterson's solution for the critical section problem.**  
   Peterson's algorithm uses two variables (flag array and turn) for two processes to achieve mutual exclusion. A process sets its flag and turn to the other, then waits if the other's flag is set and it's not its turn. Ensures mutual exclusion without hardware support.

10. **What is bounded waiting? Why is it important in synchronization?**  
    Bounded waiting ensures a process enters its critical section within a finite time, preventing starvation. Important for fairness in concurrent systems where processes compete for resources.

11. **What are the main issues in concurrency?**  
    Issues: Non-atomic operations leading to race conditions, blocking (processes wait indefinitely), starvation (low-priority processes ignored), deadlock (circular waits). Requires careful synchronization to mitigate.

12. **Explain the producer-consumer problem and how semaphores solve it.**  
    Producers generate data for a bounded buffer; consumers remove it. Issue: Overflow/underflow without sync. Semaphores solve it: Mutex for mutual exclusion on buffer, full/empty counting semaphores to track slots.

#### MCQ-Style Questions
These are common in screening rounds; I've included options, correct answers, and brief explanations based on aggregated patterns.

13. **The two types of semaphores are?**  
    Options: a) Binary and Counting, b) Shared and Exclusive, c) Read and Write, d) Public and Private.  
    Answer: a) Binary and Counting.  
    Explanation: Binary for single resource (0/1), counting for multiple (≥0).

14. **Which operations are atomic in semaphores?**  
    Options: a) Wait and Signal, b) Read and Write, c) Lock and Unlock, d) Start and End.  
    Answer: a) Wait and Signal.  
    Explanation: Wait decrements (blocks if zero), signal increments to release.

15. **How many minimum variables are required to solve the critical section problem?**  
    Options: a) 1, b) 2, c) 3, d) 4.  
    Answer: a) 1.  
    Explanation: A single shared variable like a semaphore suffices for mutual exclusion.

16. **Semaphore is a/an ______ and helps solve the problem of ______?**  
    Options: a) Variable, Deadlock, b) Integer, Mutual Exclusion, c) Counter, Resource Allocation, d) Lock, Process Synchronization.  
    Answer: b) Integer, Mutual Exclusion.  
    Explanation: As an integer, it enforces exclusive access to critical sections.

17. **Is mutual exclusion required for shareable resources?**  
    Options: a) True, b) False.  
    Answer: b) False.  
    Explanation: Shareable resources (e.g., read-only files) allow concurrent access without sync.

18. **What happens if a non-recursive mutex is locked more than once?**  
    Options: a) Priority inversion, b) Deadlock, c) Starvation, d) No effect.  
    Answer: b) Deadlock.  
    Explanation: The thread waits for its own lock, causing indefinite block.

19. **In a concurrent system with shared critical_flag initialized to FALSE, if two processes check and set it simultaneously, what happens?**  
    Options: a) Mutual exclusion holds, b) Both enter critical region, c) Deadlock occurs, d) Starvation.  
    Answer: b) Both enter critical region.  
    Explanation: Without atomic test-and-set, race allows concurrent access.

20. **Which order of P operations on binary semaphores avoids deadlock in concurrent processes X, Y, Z?**  
    Options: (From GATE-like example) a) X:P(a)P(b)P(c) Y:P(b)P(c)P(d) Z:P(c)P(d)P(a), b) X:P(b)P(a)P(c) Y:P(b)P(c)P(d) Z:P(a)P(c)P(d), etc.  
    Answer: b) X:P(b)P(a)P(c) Y:P(b)P(c)P(d) Z:P(a)P(c)P(d).  
    Explanation: Prevents circular wait by consistent acquisition order.

These questions cover ~80% of synchronization and concurrency topics in interviews. Practice scenarios like producer-consumer or dining philosophers, and refer to resources like GeeksforGeeks or InterviewBit for variations.

These focus on definitions, conditions, prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery. Questions often test understanding of scenarios where processes are blocked indefinitely and strategies to handle them, including algorithms like Banker's. I've included descriptive and MCQ formats with concise answers/explanations, drawn from real interview reports.

#### Descriptive Questions
1. **What is a deadlock in an operating system?**  
   A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another, leading to a standstill. It occurs in multiprogramming environments and can halt system progress.

2. **What are the necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur?**  
   The four Coffman conditions must hold: Mutual Exclusion (resources can't be shared), Hold and Wait (processes hold resources while waiting for others), No Preemption (resources can't be forcibly taken), and Circular Wait (processes form a cycle of waiting).

3. **Differentiate between deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance.**  
   Prevention eliminates one of the Coffman conditions upfront (e.g., no hold and wait by allocating all resources at start). Avoidance dynamically checks requests to ensure safe states (e.g., using Banker's algorithm), allowing more flexibility but with runtime overhead.

4. **Explain the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance.**  
   Banker's algorithm simulates resource allocation to check if granting a request leads to a safe state (where all processes can complete). It uses need, available, max, and allocation matrices to find a safe sequence, avoiding unsafe states.

5. **What is a resource allocation graph (RAG)? How does it help in deadlock detection?**  
   RAG is a directed graph with processes as circles and resources as squares; request edges (process to resource) and assignment edges (resource to process). A cycle indicates potential deadlock; if resources are single-instance, a cycle means deadlock.

6. **What is a safe state in deadlock avoidance?**  
   A safe state is one where there exists a sequence for allocating resources to all processes without deadlock. An unsafe state may lead to deadlock, but not necessarily.

7. **How can deadlocks be prevented? Give strategies.**  
   Strategies: Ensure no mutual exclusion (use shareable resources), no hold and wait (allocate all at once or release before requesting), allow preemption (take resources from waiting processes), or break circular wait (order resource requests numerically).

8. **Explain deadlock detection and recovery methods.**  
   Detection uses algorithms like wait-for graphs (cycle detection) or modified Banker's. Recovery: Preempt resources, rollback processes, or terminate one/more processes (e.g., by priority or cost).

9. **What is the difference between deadlock and starvation?**  
   Deadlock is a circular wait where no process proceeds; starvation is when a low-priority process waits indefinitely due to higher-priority ones, but others may progress.

10. **Can deadlock occur with a single resource? Explain.**  
    No, because circular wait requires at least two resources and processes. With one resource, it's just mutual exclusion and hold/wait, but no cycle.

#### MCQ-Style Questions
These are common in screening rounds; I've included options, correct answers, and brief explanations based on aggregated patterns.

11. **Which of the following is NOT a necessary condition for deadlock?**  
    Options: a) Mutual Exclusion, b) Hold and Wait, c) No Preemption, d) Starvation.  
    Answer: d) Starvation.  
    Explanation: Starvation is a different issue; the four conditions are mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.

12. **A system is in a safe state if?**  
    Options: a) The system can allocate resources to each process in some order and still avoid a deadlock, b) All processes are deadlocked, c) Resources are unlimited, d) Circular wait exists.  
    Answer: a) The system can allocate resources to each process in some order and still avoid a deadlock.  
    Explanation: Safe state ensures a finishing sequence exists for all processes.

13. **In resource allocation graph, a cycle always indicates?**  
    Options: a) Deadlock, b) Potential deadlock, c) Safe state, d) No deadlock.  
    Answer: b) Potential deadlock.  
    Explanation: For multiple-instance resources, a cycle may not mean deadlock; for single-instance, it does.

14. **The Banker's algorithm is used for?**  
    Options: a) Deadlock prevention, b) Deadlock avoidance, c) Deadlock detection, d) Deadlock recovery.  
    Answer: b) Deadlock avoidance.  
    Explanation: It checks requests to prevent unsafe states dynamically.

15. **Which strategy breaks the circular wait condition to prevent deadlock?**  
    Options: a) Resource ordering, b) Preemption, c) Hold and wait allowance, d) Mutual exclusion removal.  
    Answer: a) Resource ordering.  
    Explanation: Assigning a total order to resources prevents cycles by enforcing acquisition in sequence.

16. **If a resource-allocation graph has no cycle, then?**  
    Options: a) Deadlock exists, b) No deadlock, c) Unsafe state, d) Starvation.  
    Answer: b) No deadlock.  
    Explanation: Absence of cycle means no circular wait, so no deadlock.

17. **Which of the following is a deadlock recovery technique?**  
    Options: a) Process termination, b) Resource preemption, c) Rollback, d) All of these.  
    Answer: d) All of these.  
    Explanation: Recovery involves breaking the deadlock by terminating, preempting, or rolling back processes.

18. **A reusable resource is one that?**  
    Options: a) Can be used by one process at a time and is not depleted, b) Is depleted after use, c) Can be shared without limit, d) Causes deadlock always.  
    Answer: a) Can be used by one process at a time and is not depleted.  
    Explanation: Examples include printers; they contribute to deadlocks via mutual exclusion.

These questions cover ~80% of deadlock topics in interviews. Practice scenarios like dining philosophers or Banker's calculations, and refer to resources like GeeksforGeeks or Sanfoundry for variations.

## Evaluation & Explanations:

### Question 1 (Error Spotting)
**Your Answer:** (No answer provided)
**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The correct preposition to use with "since" when referring to a duration of time is "for". The sentence should be "The students were waiting for the bus for the last one hour." or more naturally, "The students had been waiting for the bus for the last hour."

### Question 2 (Sentence Correction)
**Your Answer:** Each of the student has submitted their assignments
**Correct Answer:** Each of the students has submitted his or her assignment.
**Explanation:** "Each of the students" is singular, so the verb should be "has". Also, "students" should remain plural, and "assignments" should be singular "assignment" to match "each student". Pronoun agreement is also important; "his or her" is more formally correct than "their" in this context, though "their" is increasingly accepted.

### Question 3 (Fill in the Blanks)
**Your Answer:** A
**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** "Proficient" means skilled or competent, which fits perfectly in the context of being skilled in both technical skills and communication.

### Question 4 (Synonym)
**Your Answer:** A
**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** "Benevolent" means well-meaning and kindly. "Kind" is the correct synonym. "Malevolent" is the opposite.

### Question 5 (Antonym)
**Your Answer:** (No answer provided)
**Correct Answer:** A

### Question 6 (Idiom/Phrase)

### Question 7 (Reading Comprehension)

**Correct Answer:** BDCAE
**Explanation:** The correct order is B (introduces the topic), D (adds to B), C (explains D), A (concludes the reasoning), E (final conclusion). Your sequence had A and E swapped.

### Question 9 (Prepositions)
**Your Answer:** A
**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The correct preposition is "at". "Good at" is the standard phrase for skill or proficiency.

### Question 10 (Articles)
**Your Answer:** B
**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** "An" is used before a vowel sound. "Interesting" begins with a vowel sound, so "an" is correct.

### Question 11 (Tenses)
**Your Answer:** A
**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** The past perfect tense "had left" is correct here because the action (train leaving) happened before another past action (arriving at the station).

### Question 12 (Voice)
**Your Answer:** The student is praised by the teacher
**Correct Answer:** The student was praised by the teacher.
**Explanation:** The original sentence is in past tense, so the passive voice should also be in past tense ("was praised").

### Question 13 (Narration)
**Your Answer:** He said , "He is going to the market"
**Correct Answer:** He said that he was going to the market.
**Explanation:** In indirect speech, the pronoun changes from "I" to "he", and the tense usually shifts back ("am" to "was"). Also, the comma and quotation marks are not used in indirect speech.

### Question 14 (Error Spotting)
**Your Answer:** no error
**Correct Answer:** C
**Explanation:** "The number of students" is singular, so the verb should be "is" not "are". The correct sentence is "The number of students who are attending the workshop is quite large."

### Question 15 (Sentence Correction)
**Your Answer:** The team are working hard to complete the project In time.
**Correct Answer:** The team is working hard to complete the project on time.
**Explanation:** "The team" is a collective noun and is treated as singular in American English, so the verb should be "is". Also, the correct phrase is "on time", not "In time".

### Question 16 (Fill in the Blanks)
**Your Answer:** A
**Correct Answer:** A
**Explanation:** "Barely" means "only just" or "scarcely", which fits the context of being so tired that one can hardly stand. "Nearly" and "almost" are close in meaning but "barely" and "scarcely" are more precise for this context.

### Question 17 (Synonym)

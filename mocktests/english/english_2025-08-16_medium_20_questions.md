### Feedback:

You've scored 11 out of 20 questions correctly, which is 55%. This is a decent start, but there's room for improvement. Let's discuss the questions you got wrong:

1. Question 1: The correct spelling is "Accommodation" with two 'c's and two 'm's. This is a commonly misspelled word.

2. Question 3: "Benevolent" means kind or charitable, not malevolent (which means evil or harmful).

3. Question 5: "Abstain" means to restrain oneself from indulging in or doing something. Its opposite is "indulge."

4. Question 7: The correct punctuation is option B. When quoting someone, we use double quotation marks and a comma before the closing quotation mark.

5. Question 9: The error is in "have" (option B). "Each" is singular, so it should be "has" not "have."

6. Question 12: The correct spelling is "Embarrassment" with two 'r's and two 's's. Another commonly misspelled word.

7. Question 14: "Diligent" means hard-working or industrious, not negligent or careless.

8. Question 16: "Committee" is a collective noun that is treated as plural, so the correct verb is "are," not "is."

9. Question 18: "The wind whispered" is personification because it gives human qualities (whispering) to a non-human thing (wind).

To improve, focus on:
- Spelling rules and common misspellings
- Understanding word meanings and their opposites
- Grammar rules for collective nouns and subject-verb agreement
- Identifying figures of speech

# DSA Mock Test - Easy Difficulty

## Question 1
What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array by index?

### Options
A) O(1)
B) O(n)
C) O(log n)
D) O(n^2)

### Your Answer:
A

### Correct Answer:
A

### Explanation:
Accessing an element in an array by index is a constant time operation O(1) because arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations.

## Question 2
Which data structure uses LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle?

### Options
A) Queue
B) Stack
C) Array
D) Linked List

### Your Answer:
B

### Correct Answer:
B

### Explanation:
Stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle, where the last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

## Question 3

### Options
A) O(1)
B) O(n)
C) O(log n)
D) O(n^2)

### Your Answer:

### Options
A) Tree
B) Graph
C) Array
D) Hash Table

### Your Answer:
C

### Options
A) Bubble Sort
B) Selection Sort
C) Merge Sort
D) Insertion Sort

### Your Answer:
C

### Correct Answer:

### Options
A) O(1)
B) O(n)
C) O(log n)
D) O(n^2)

Finding the maximum element in an unsorted array requires checking all elements, resulting in O(n) time complexity.

## Question 12
Which data structure is used for implementing recursion?

### Options
A) Queue
B) Stack
C) Array
D) Linked List

### Your Answer:
D

### Correct Answer:
B

### Explanation:
Stack is used for implementing recursion because of its LIFO property, which matches how function calls are managed (the last function called is the first to return).

## Question 13
What is the time complexity of traversing all elements in a linked list?

### Options
A) O(1)
B) O(n)
C) O(log n)
D) O(n^2)

### Your Answer:

## Question 14
Which of the following is not a stable sorting algorithm?

### Options
A) Merge Sort
B) Bubble Sort
C) Quick Sort
D) Insertion Sort

### Your Answer:
C(I GUESS AND I AMN NOT SURE WHAT DO THEY MEAN BY STABLE)

### Correct Answer:
C

### Explanation:
A stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of equal elements. Quick Sort is not stable because it may change the relative order of equal elements during partitioning. Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort are all stable sorting algorithms.

## Question 15
What is the auxiliary space complexity of merge sort?

### Options
A) O(1)
B) O(n)
C) O(log n)
D) O(n^2)

### Your Answer:

## Question 16
In a binary search tree, which traversal gives elements in sorted order?

### Options
A) Pre-order
B) Post-order
C) In-order
D) Level-order

### Options
A) Stack
B) Queue
C) Array
D) Linked List

### Your Answer:
D

### Correct Answer:

C) O(log n)
D) O(n^2)

### Options
A) Queue
B) Stack
C) Array
D) Linked List

### Your Answer:

B) (rear + 1) % size == front
C) rear == size - 1
D) front == 0

### Your Answer:
A

### Correct Answer:
B

### Explanation:
In a circular queue, the condition to check if the queue is full is (rear + 1) % size == front. This is because one position is left empty to differentiate between full and empty states.

## Question 27
What is the time complexity of heap sort in the worst case?

### Options
A) O(1)
B) O(n)
C) O(n log n)
D) O(n^2)

### Your Answer:
C

### Correct Answer:
C

### Options
A) l
B) 2l
C) 2^l
D) 2^(l+1)

### Explanation:
In a binary tree, the maximum number of nodes at level l is 2^l. For example, level 0 (root) has 2^0 = 1 node, level 1 has 2^1 = 2 nodes, and so on.

## Score: 21/30

You did well on this DSA mock test! You have a good understanding of most fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts. Here are some areas where your understanding could be refined:

1. Data structures for recursion - Stack is used for implementing recursion, not just any data structure.
2. Traversing a linked list - This takes O(n) time as you need to visit each node once.
3. Stable sorting algorithms - A stable sort maintains the relative order of equal elements. Quick Sort is not stable.
4. Auxiliary space complexity of merge sort - It's O(n) due to the temporary arrays used during merging.
5. Building a heap - It can be done in O(n) time using bottom-up construction.
6. BFS data structure - Queue is used for BFS, not just any data structure.
7. DFS data structure - Stack is used for DFS, not just any data structure.
8. Circular queue full condition - It's (rear + 1) % size == front, not just front == rear.

Would you like to discuss any of these concepts in more detail?
